<p>So often the SMEs we work with want to throw people into the middle of the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was talking about <a href="https://ngombor.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ngombor Community Development Alliance</a> in the <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Write the Docs Slack</a> recently and someone asked me what Ngombor had to do with documentation.</p>
<p>It was an excellent question as I&#x27;d thrown some Ngombor information at a channel without contextualizing. I&#x27;d been a terrible technical writer, marketer and organizational storyteller. What did fundraising for a community organization in Uganda have to do with technical writing? For some, it was a logical continuation of a conversation. For others it was baffling to be suddenly thrust into the middle of a conversation where they did not have the context to understand what I was talking about. In the heat of the moment, how would someone tell the difference between me and any random person trying to sell a product?</p>
<p>So often the SMEs we work with want to throw people into the middle of the conversation. They&#x27;ve been working on something for months, maybe years and they just want to display the logical conclusion. It&#x27;s frustrating. I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve needed to help engineers understand that a little bit of context, a little bit of grounding information at the top of the doc is not patronizing, it&#x27;s not unnecessarily slowing people down. Context and introductory information helps people (or machines), who are not in the middle of whatever the conversation is, access the meaning of a document. It helps people who might not have the precise words for describing their situation, find their way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Ngombor + Technical Writing? Presumed context and the challenges of accidental insider baseball " src="/assets/images/2025-07-presumed-context-b4e32e9cb2ec01a443f3f9866636966c.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q">
<em>And I must laugh and pause here, and I hope you are laughing too. Most of the world doesn&#x27;t really play baseball, it&#x27;s not global terminology! When it comes to jargon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_baseball_(metaphor)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inside baseball</a> is a little inside baseball!</em></p>
<p>So here I was, having spent many months working on Ngombor, having been supported and inspired by members of the Write the Docs community, writing content that presumed that my collaborators were the default audience and putting everyone else in the middle of a confusing conversation.</p>
<p>We all always have return to and work on the fundamentals. It’s important to appreciate and listen to the people who give us the kindness of asking questions. We need to use this as doorways to understanding rather than things to react to. I&#x27;m so glad the question was asked. It enabled me to clarify in the Slack channel and write a blog post that goes from how we can make content more accessible to how we can all play a role addressing the damage of colonialism.</p>
<p>If you have questions, or feedback or ideas about how I or Ngombor could do better or how you&#x27;d like to be involved, please drop me a line at either <a href="mailto:liz@lizargall.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liz@lizargall.com</a> or <a href="mailto:info@ngombor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@ngombor.com</a>.</p>
<p>Now onto some contextual information, here goes...</p>
<p>I&#x27;m Liz Argall, I&#x27;m a co-founder of Ngombor. Ngombor is a non profit based in Uganda that combines agriculture and tech to make a lasting difference in the West Nile part of Africa. The organization is new, but it builds on 20 year friendship between my father and Vincent Ulargiw. I&#x27;d like to tell you a story about how technical writing and founding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">permaculture</a> model farm in Uganda are intimately related.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Ngombor means hope" src="/assets/images/2025-07-ngombor1-5770c8fe16b458ff7c2b2a32107779a7.png" width="1280" height="1280" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ngombors-origin-story">Ngombor&#x27;s origin story<a href="#ngombors-origin-story" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ngombor&#x27;s origin story" title="Direct link to Ngombor&#x27;s origin story">​</a></h2>

<p>Ngombor Community Development Alliance got its start around January this year. I was in final round interviews with <a href="https://canonical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canonical</a> as a Technical Author and thanks to the holidays we were in month three of the process. As part of my research I came across Ngazetungue Muheue&#x27;s Ubuntu Summit talk</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPP7amqTGFA?si=lyMjkZ2Cq5WMSW_2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe>
<p>His talk is a wonderful and powerful call to action around how Africa needs meaningful partnerships and friendship far more than random chunks of cash, trapped in hustle culture. His talk inspired me to reach out to Vincent Ulargiw, a friend of my father&#x27;s for 20 years. I hadn&#x27;t spoken to Vince since my father had died in 2023. My dad and Vince had become friends after dad helped Vince found a trade school in the DR Congo to support women escaping difficult circumstances or abandonment. My dad paid for their first sewing machines. Vince was across the border in Uganda, so acted as a coordinator, connector and person with a bank account who, unlike people across the border in Congo, was able to safely receive money.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Vince Ulargiw standing in what will will become Ngombor model farm" src="/assets/images/2025-07-ngombor3-32a8e11bd55aeeab88305f2636d4ce5e.jpg" width="1020" height="765" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="muheues-talk-needs-to-be-shared-and-acted-upon">Muheue&#x27;s talk needs to be shared and acted upon<a href="#muheues-talk-needs-to-be-shared-and-acted-upon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Muheue&#x27;s talk needs to be shared and acted upon" title="Direct link to Muheue&#x27;s talk needs to be shared and acted upon">​</a></h3>
<p>So I wrote to Vince and said, &quot;I&#x27;m inspired by this YouTube video and if there&#x27;s any way a technical writer could help you folks connect to open source let me know.&quot; Vince said, &quot;Thank you, what I really want to do is found a permaculture model farm!&quot; We got to talking, which distracted me a little bit from preparing for my Canonical interview, but I’m glad it turned out that way. Vince’s plans were massively ambitious and somewhat impossible, but I looked at how I could help him explore the concept and what I could say yes to, rather than what seemed impossible.</p>
<p>So I said, &quot;Ok, well to start with, we&#x27;ll need a website, and in terms of empowerment, lets teach folks in Nebbi how to build and maintain the website.&quot; This was a starting point that was in my wheelhouse. I was a little overwhelmed by how I was suddenly helping Vince found a permaculture farm. It was not what I had anticipated when I&#x27;d reached out, but I wanted to do what I could.</p>
<p>I also knew, from the experience of my father and the call to action from Muheue&#x27;s talk, that turning up for 10 minutes every week was more important than being a flash in the pan. We didn&#x27;t have a clear map when we started out, but I knew that turning up regularly was something I could do.</p>
<p>I knew that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAONlfoNVuY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from little things big things grow</a>. I knew that Vince was a great human being, and I knew that the community around him was great as well. I knew that if we were to build a thing we&#x27;d do it a step at a time. I knew we&#x27;d need to talk to a lot of people and get a lot of blank looks, but I knew that if we kept at it, something would happen. I knew that building a website could be done with a text editor and free hosting on GitHub, <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-ngombors-sustainable-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unlike the cost of building a farm</a>.</p>
<p>In these early stages of, &quot;What exactly have I signed up for?!&quot; I reached out to the Write the Docs Slack and asked for recommendations for the best path for building a website. I asked static website generator? Wordpress? HTML? We discussed the options and agreed that plain HTML and CSS would be the best approach, provide a foundation that could build towards programming.</p>

<p>I was trying to teach Vince HTML remotely over email and the logistics of it (not to mention the time zone differences) was feeling a little bit impossible. I thought, if someone in Uganda can teach him GitHub then he can set up his students with that and it will be easier for us to swap files and see what we&#x27;re doing. If we can set it up properly, maybe we can chunk work up into simpler, smaller bite sized pieces that would make it easier for other volunteers to come help us.</p>
<p>I thought, there&#x27;s no way I can teach Vince how to use GitHub remotely if we&#x27;re struggling with HTML! So I looked around for local resources. I found out where <a href="https://ug.pycon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyCon Uganda</a> was held in 2024 and asked if there was someone who could teach Vince GitHub next time he was in Kampala.</p>
<p>For context Nebbi District, where Ngombor is based, is a day&#x27;s travel to get to Kampala. It&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s accessible to most people in Nebbi, but Vince was going to be in Kampala the following month, so I wondered if someone could spend half an hour showing Vince GitHub.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Map showing Nebbi near the DR Congo border in Northern Uganda, with an arrow showing the long distance to get to Kampala in Central District" src="/assets/images/nebbi-kampala-e52c3609e83583066d6e5c16d28dba03.png" width="1546" height="918" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>I was hoping for half an hour and maybe a chance to get to know folks for future collaborations. What we got was PyLadies excited to include us in their projects and an invitation to not just go to the next meetup, but be given lunch and shown around Kampala! The meetup was an introduction to data science and it was a remarkable experience. If you go to the <a href="https://ngombor.org/#impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact section</a> of Ngombor&#x27;s website you&#x27;ll see just how powerful it was to send four people to this meetup.</p>
<p>At this meetup, Ngombor&#x27;s wonderful Chairperson, Laurine Afoyorwoth, touched a computer for the first time. Laurine, a smallholder farmer and Village Health Team Coordinator for Jupuwiny Village, was excited about doing her own data collection/science long hand and encouraging family and community to learn IT. This is a big deal in a place where there can be a big sense of divide between subsistence farmers in rural areas and white collar workers in the city.</p>
<p>We didn&#x27;t get to GitHub, but we got something more. It wasn&#x27;t just working with PyLadies that was impactful. This was Ngombor&#x27;s first project. At the time we didn&#x27;t have a logo, we didn&#x27;t even have a bank account. Having such a useful experience helped demonstrate to ourselves, as well as others, that we were real.</p>

<p>As I continued working on Ngombor, the Write the Docs Slack has been a place to let off steam and ask questions in relevant to documentation or the broader open source world we connect to. When you&#x27;re founding something new, having multiple spaces, mentors and comrades is so important. Even if it&#x27;s just a little note that helps you and get out of your own head.</p>
<p>Most recently I got some good guidance when I asked folks for helpful meetup resources. The response was primarily, check out Write the Docs <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting a Meetup</a> article. A simple pointer to a doc, should I be embarrassed that I could have just searched online? No, because the conversation and the focus helped. I&#x27;d previously dismissed this exact resource because Nebbi is far away from Kampala. Who could we get to be as speakers? It seemed so far out of reach.</p>
<p>I was tempted to dismiss the resource again, but I wrestled with it. Someone had taken the time to share a resource with me, I wanted to respect their effort. I wrestled with it some more and realized I&#x27;d fallen into colonial thinking. I had it stuck in my head that the big city was where the experts were and that&#x27;s who we needed to bring in.</p>
<p>I realized that a lot of what we&#x27;re doing is computer literacy, not fancy programming. There are absolutely local folks that can come and talk about using computers and help folks on their way. It is so easy to accidentally fall into colonial thinking, wherever you are in the world. It&#x27;s so helpful to have fresh inputs that can help you see things differently.</p>

<p>Ngombor is a work in progress, it evolves. So much about starting an organization is about communication, so my skills as a writer have served me more times that I can count. My experience wrestling with large documentation projects helps me triage what is important. If I do get stuck in the weeds, I can at least recognize it and give myself a kind smile and a laugh.</p>
<p>What I love about Technical Writing is how it makes more of the world more accessible to more people. When it&#x27;s in documentation it doesn&#x27;t depend on finding out who holds the lore and how they like their coffee! With good technical writing people should feel invited and welcomed into participation, not feel like they have to prove themselves to gate keepers. I like to say documentation is a human rights issue. We all have a right to be able to participate without currying favor.</p>
<p>Technical writing is about creating empowering spaces that support others achieve their goals. Technical writing is about being there for people when they&#x27;re frazzled and annoyed and just want to get back to playing the game.</p>
<p>The philosophies and skills of Technical Writing have helped me co-found Ngombor. With the help of lots of different folks around the globe we are enabling a impactful, empowering, community owned and led difference in Uganda.</p>

<p>Africa has been through some pretty horrible stuff thanks to colonialism, and I think it&#x27;s good for the soul to help out in a way that&#x27;s meaningful for you. Africa is not a big monolith you have to save. It&#x27;s a place full of different countries, cultures, spaces and people where your attention can help.</p>
<p>Ngombor is a non profit based in Uganda that combines agriculture and tech to make a lasting difference in the West Nile part of Africa. The organization is new, but it builds on 20 year friendship between <a href="https://dennis.argall.info/about/about-dennis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my father</a> and Vincent Ulargiw. The combination of old and new means that your ability to effect change through donations is powerful. What folks have been able to do with the scantest of resources has been humbling, and we can do so much more.</p>
<p>Whether you heed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPP7amqTGFA?si=lyMjkZ2Cq5WMSW_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ngazetungue Muheue&#x27;s challenge</a> by connecting or reconnecting with other worthy organizations and individuals in Africa or dip your toes in the water by giving a little to us, it is a rewarding and satisfying thing to do. Muheue&#x27;s call to action can feel like a lot if you&#x27;ve never collaborated with folks in Africa or haven&#x27;t collaborated with people in rural and remote areas.</p>
<p>Most people date a little before they settle into something sustained. Unfortunately through the tyrannies of distance and disadvantage, most people don&#x27;t have a chance to try out light levels of engagement that aren&#x27;t in themselves tied up in colonialism (maybe support community led awesomeness rather than &quot;save&quot; a child?).</p>

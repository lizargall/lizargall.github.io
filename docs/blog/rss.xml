            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This essay started as a love letter to mindfully turning up. I wanted to write about the power that comes from turning up a little bit at a time consistently. As I attended to the work of blogging regularly it evolved to be a love letter to processes, structures, systems and their interconnections. This essay gives you a tour of philosophies and metaphors that may feel disconnected at first, but all feed into creating meaningful, effective work while avoiding burnout.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of this essay, I've only done minimal edits while typing. This essay is a love letter after all, and it wouldn't do to over work it!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-begin">Let's begin<a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/process#lets-begin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let's begin" title="Direct link to Let's begin">​</a></h3>
<p>Over the last few blog posts, I've shared some resources for mindfully turning up for your docs and for yourself.</p>
<p>If you look at these resources you might get a sense of overwhelm. OMG, there's so much to do and I haven't done it all! It's easy for your mind to shut down and decide, if you can't do it all, what's the point?</p>
<p>All of these resources have evolved over time, through a combination of trial and error, research and reflection. And so it should go with your implementation. All of these structures are there to foster better conversations and give you different ways of focusing your attention through different helpful structures.</p>
<p>If you glance at the templates briefly, perhaps that sparks an idea or irritates you in an interesting direction. When we mindfully observe and work through patterns, templates and philosophies with a curious mind it can enrich many domains in our lives. I'm a better Aikido practitioner thanks to how deeply I care about technical writing. I am a better technical writer and colleague by thinking about how I can apply Aikido to the workplace.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-joy-of-mindful-practice">The joy of mindful practice<a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/process#the-joy-of-mindful-practice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The joy of mindful practice" title="Direct link to The joy of mindful practice">​</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.matthewsyed.co.uk/book/bounce-the-myth-of-talent-and-the-power-of-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bounce: the Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice</em></a>, by Matthew Syed, Syed reflects on how so much of what we perceive as talent is practice that we don't see. Sometimes we don't even see our own practice, because it's "just fun" or we don't see how expertise in one domain can contribute to another.</p>
<p>In Bounce, Syed explores how it's not just any practice that helps you grow. Syed was the number one table tennis player in the UK for many years and was an Olympian twice. When he goes through his own origin story he explores how a series of happy coincidences created an environment where he was able to practice with pleasure from an early age and then have the chance to train with technical rigor at school.</p>
<p>Doing just any old practice won't make you an expert. If you practice half-heartedly doing something, 10,000 hours won't feel like expertise, it'll feel like a chore and you'll become an expert at drudging through something with diminished attention.</p>
<p>I'll never forget watching Richard Sherman, a remarkable American football player (if sadly in the news for the wrong reasons these days), warming up before a game. It was the best part of the whole day. While other people were going through the motions doing warmups to get through warmups, he was giving every motion his full attention. Every lunge, every rotation of his body, committed fully to the exercise and not bouncing out of it before completing the full stretch. His focus and ability to use this "simple" task to work with every part of his body is a memory I treasure and carry with me into my practices.</p>
<p>When Richard Sherman warmed up he aligned his consciousness with his body with his activity, filling it with intention and power. It's not just how much we practice, it's how we practice.</p>

<p><a href="https://sanger.umich.edu/news-1-2-19-ema-aikido/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aikido</a> has been a love of mine since I was 19 years old, and I've been with present dojo for about a decade. When I bow in, I try to empty my mind, splosh out all the stuff that's been building in my head. I set an intention to be present for what that practice is and to learn deeply, whether we're doing a "basic" technique or an advanced move.</p>
<p>Emptying my head helps me be present for my fellow Aikidoki as they are, not what I think they are. It helps me listen closely to newer folks, their struggles teach me so much about my craft, as new users and new minds can help me learn about my docs. Emptying my head and staying grounded in my practice helps me listen closely to the folks who have been around longer than me, my subject matter experts (SMEs). Sometimes I might be baffled about how they're trying to teach me something. If I listen closely and remain open to their teaching I can find out if they're actually trying to teach me something else. Sometimes I see how the struggles of old hands are similar to the struggles of newer folks. We can laugh at the commonalities, how we all benefit from returning to the beginning and always working on our foundations.</p>
<p>Through the constraints and structures of practice, it happens at a certain place at a certain time, our techniques have a shared vocabulary and certain people lead the experience, I have an organizational structure to actively learn in. No matter what we do at practice, I'm doing Aikido with my whole attention and that is satisfying.</p>
<p>When we mindfully turn up and know we are operating in a helpful structure, we can set aside (or turn down the volume) on a whole range of worries and perfectionisms. The question isn't, "Am I good enough?" The question becomes, "Am I doing Aikido?"</p>
<p>We can see the value of helpful structures in so many fields and amongst so many people who perform at high levels. We can see these helpful structures in the ways we build communities and interact.</p>

<p><a href="https://permacultureprinciples.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permaculture</a>, a philosophy and practice for sustainable land management and communities, posits the questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I listening to the ecosystem?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Am I trying to force my will and how "things should be" onto documents or architecture without working through what that means for that workplace and userbase?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can I obtain a yield?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Am I getting caught up in elaborate structures when I should be focused on smaller user stories?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do I use edges and the marginal? How am I catching and storing energy? Are we paying attention to the correct level of design?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Do I need to educate people that messy is ok, especially in forming and storming phases?</li>
<li>Do people feel safe contributing and that mistakes and imperfection are ok?</li>
<li>Am I getting bogged down in copy editing perfection when that time would be better served working on the big picture?</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Permaculture can then blend into the <a href="https://diataxis.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diataxis framework</a>, which isn't about bludgeoning documentation into a specific shape. It's a map that helps you articulate natural rhythms that are pleasing. Diataxis can help create clarity around:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of each nugget of information.</li>
<li>Developing a consistent template for readmes and features.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I find I apply all of Diataxis on a single page, far more than splitting things out.</li>
<li>I've found engineers find it easier to align with a template if there is a methodology behind it, it's not just me having ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trust that messy and incomplete is part of the process.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Permaculture is a valuable framework, but it's nice to have a call to authority that says, "Things looking bad can be a sign of improvement."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SMEs can find it easier to onboard people and manage the OTT infodump if you tell them their deep understanding has a place.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I've used Diataxis and the "teaching someone to cook" metaphor to help SMEs understand that there is a time and place for explanation, but first we need to get folks into the kitchen.</li>
<li>Saying how-to guides are like recipes has helped SMEs understand when a tutorial is required and when it's a how-to. This clear distinction has made it much easier to build trust, as programmers fear being patronizing or being patronized to. Don't worry, I wont tell you to wash your hands when it's a recipe card!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The best fertilizer is the gardener's shadow.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Ok, that saying is taken from gardening, but at its heart, Diataxis is just a framework for mindfully turning up for your docs and improving a bit here and there.</li>
<li>It's a continual practice, not an end point.</li>

<p>Diataxis can blend nicely into <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/open-source-culture-9-core-principles-and-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source principles</a> such as do-ocracy, collaboration and self-organization (how you turn up for your part of the garden might be really different to mine, but we both want it to thrive and a shared vocabulary helps). Open Source can invite questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are we listening to our communities?</li>
<li>How do we build environments of collaboration and respect?</li>
<li>How do we support the do-ers and make sure we're not burning through volunteers?</li>

<p>Open source blends nicely into <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agile methodologies</a>, where a few of the questions it asks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are we creating chunks of work that are purposeful?</li>
<li>How are we collaborating cross-functionally and with our customers?</li>
<li>What can we achieve now?</li>
<li>How are we valuing the energy and time of all the individuals that make up the whole?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>As Permaculture would say, "Use and value renewable resources and services"</li>

<p>The spreadsheets I've created should have value if you glance at them. They should have greater value if you use them as a structure.</p>
<p>In Aikido, I know that if I've turned up on the mat and given my focused attention for an hour, I have done good work.</p>
<p>If I spend an hour working on a search term analysis, I will have done good work. I may have improved my docs, gained a greater understanding of user experience or experienced great waves of despair as I encounter places my docs fall short. What matters on a fundamental level is that you've practiced within a supportive framework and have turned up.</p>
<p>If you don't have a structure it can be easy to think, "What have I done? I've done nothing today!" This is especially true if you encounter problems in the docs thanks to your diligence. When you don't have a container to hold and witness your work it can be easy to lose perspective.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-map-is-not-the-territory">The map is not the territory<a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/process#the-map-is-not-the-territory" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The map is not the territory" title="Direct link to The map is not the territory">​</a></h2>
<p>Various helpful structures can help you see your content in new and novel ways. They can disrupt comfortable modes of seeing and get you closer to the experience of a new user. They are helpful maps, but the map is not the territory.</p>
<p>Maps can be helpful for pointing out phenomena in our shared physical universe, but they are always incomplete. They have to be, or we'd be drowned in noise. One map might be full of contour lines and show where dry riverbeds sometimes flow. Another map might crisply and cleanly focus on roads and provide the latest prices at gas stations.</p>
<p>Neither map is wrong, they just have different purposes. Sometimes, the most beautiful thing as you explore the territory is to see what seemingly disparate maps have in common. To attend to the work, to gain experience, to think deeply and see how your maps build into a larger story is satisfying.</p>

<p>When we talk about <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331088095_Beyond_Accuracy_What_Documentation_Quality_Means_to_Readers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content quality</a>, findability is an important factor that extends beyond clean architecture. "Can the user find the data?" is a common question. Can the user find the data if they start with a Google search takes us deeper into this investigation.</p>
<p>At the Write the Docs Conference in Portland this year I gave a lightning talk on "Google Magic!" It showed how and get insight into your documentation in five minutes. Through this approach you can get a clearer understanding of your users and identify the most impactful ways to improve your docs.</p>

<p>Users who actually provide feedback are a small percentage of our user base. They are often important users, they're the super users who care and will help others use our tools and services. Statistically, however, people who give feedback are outliers.</p>
<p>When you conduct a search term analysis you can think through many user personas as you come up with terms and get a suite of benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify content gaps and pain points</li>
<li>Prioritize content based on real-world queries</li>
<li>Interact with your content in fresh new ways helps you refresh your content</li>

<p>For this new spreadsheet, I created a tab exploring how you could analyze user experiences if they ask an LLM questions. I suggest using <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perplexity</a> as it is designed to provide references. It was interesting to think about how a robustly referenced Perplexity output differs from search engine output. LLMs can statistically aggregate relationships, they can provide interesting juxtapositions, but individual topics aren't explored with as much depth. LLMs provide an answer, as <a href="https://whatworks.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara McMullin</a> would say, they prioritize efficiency and authority. LLMs will never fully replace search engines, but when used well LLMs can be a launch pad for more robustly using search engines.</p>

<p>Once you've read through the instructions, decide on your focus. Start with the most pressing needs and potential pain points/unknowns and then iterate. While you could do this as part of a formal <a href="https://github.com/google/opendocs/blob/main/project_archetypes/audit.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audit process</a>, I recommend starting it as a casual investigation. Try it out, explore the benefits and please yourself before getting too fancy!</p>

<p>Unless there's a particular pain point (why can't folks find calibration information?), it's often better to chew over it, get to know your content via search term analysis over time. You may be surprised by the content improvements and insights you get exploring content in this organic, exploratory manner.</p>
<p>An analysis that fits in around other things might take a month or two. An analysis that focused on some burning questions might take a day or two!</p>

<p>What worked what didn't? Set a time for when to revisit your content, twice a year can be a helpful cadence. You may wish to schedule an analysis the month before a major announcement, so your content is prepared should there be a sudden surge in interest.</p>
<p>If you'd like to tell me how it goes, I'd love to hear about it! I'd especially love to hear about whether the LLM section is useful. Everything else in the spreadsheet is tried and tested, but that section is a new adventure.

<p>Whenever life doesn't go to plan, there is an opportunity to self reflect and find opportunities to learn and grow. This is a useful habit to cultivate and can turn adversity into an alchemical experience.</p>
<p>What is not helpful, is to look at the data, look at all the variables that go into being a human and come to the conclusion that you are a trash human/need to improve across all the criteria. This is especially challenging when you're not even sure what the criteria are, or perhaps the criteria changes as you analyze yourself from different angles.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enter-the-neurodivergent-quality-of-life-prioritization-nqlp-matrix">Enter the Neurodivergent Quality of Life Prioritization (NQLP) Matrix<a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/neurodivergent#enter-the-neurodivergent-quality-of-life-prioritization-nqlp-matrix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enter the Neurodivergent Quality of Life Prioritization (NQLP) Matrix" title="Direct link to Enter the Neurodivergent Quality of Life Prioritization (NQLP) Matrix">​</a></h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/job-search">Job Search Prioritization Matrix</a> helps you think through what sorts of jobs to look for, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NQLP Matrix</a> helps you identify what's going well in your life and what improvements you want to prioritize. You get to choose what is important to you and self accept what's not a priority right now. You can't improve on all the criteria all the time. Maybe, for example, you need to focus on understanding when you're sleep deprived and hungry, and that in itself will help your distress tolerance around people being wrong.</p>
<p>If you choose to share your matrix with others it can be a helpful conversation starter. Sometimes people have narrow or stereotyped perceptions of what it means to be Autistic or have ADHD, through the matrix you have more opportunities to show the complexity of who you are. Maybe you're an Autistic person who's great with change, but oooh, emotional regulation when things are itchy? That might be on a totally different level.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-celebration-is-just-as-important-as-the-improvements">The celebration is just as important as the improvements<a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/neurodivergent#the-celebration-is-just-as-important-as-the-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The celebration is just as important as the improvements" title="Direct link to The celebration is just as important as the improvements">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the reasons quality improvement projects can fail is because they spend too much time focusing on what needs to be improved without adequate celebration of what is going well. Don't skimp on celebrating anything that you do well.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-word-of-caution">A word of caution<a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/neurodivergent#a-word-of-caution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A word of caution" title="Direct link to A word of caution">​</a></h3>
<p>This matrix could be a great tool for you to go over with a loved one or even some managers. But, a manager should never expect an employee to work on this matrix. This matrix is emotionally intimate and needs to be driven by the person filling in the matrix, not by an outside person, especially not an outside person with power.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-word-of-thanks-and-an-invitation">A word of thanks and an invitation<a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/neurodivergent#a-word-of-thanks-and-an-invitation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A word of thanks and an invitation" title="Direct link to A word of thanks and an invitation">​</a></h3>
<p>Thanks to the Write the Docs Portland conference for inspiring this spreadsheet. I created this while thinking about what sort of lightning talk I could do. I ended up doing a completely different lightning talk, but while I was at this conference I showed it to a lot of people. Thanks to everyone who asked questions, suggested extra criteria or laughed at the shared acknowledgements of imperfection. "Management of enthusiastic info dump over chat," anyone? This matrix has been enriched by the generosity of many neurodivergent people who shared their stories and challenges. What is easy to one person can't be taken for granted by another, and this matrix helps us see ourselves and others more clearly.</p>
<p>This resource was created with neurodivergent folks in mind, if only because neurotypical people seem to be more likely to recognize when they are hungry. That said, I bet this matrix could be useful to any human. To paraphrase Rick Green, "ADHD is like height, everyone has some. It's just that if you don't realize you're 10ft tall you might think you're just really clumsy and bad with ceiling fans, when no one else has those problems. You might be so convinced you're clumsy that you never think to try out for a basketball team."</p>
<p>So, neurotypical or divergent, I encourage you to try out the spreadsheet, and I'd love to hear how it goes.</p>

<p>It would be an understatement to say that the lives of technical writers have been destabilized by the advent of generative AI. LLMs have made it clear that many people don’t understand what we do and how much technical writers create process and maintain structures. We are more than content creators!</p>
<p>Technical writers can be powerful facilitators and diplomats, bridging gaps between teams, helping more of an organization see each other more clearly. People might see our large doc sites and think “too many words!” When what they don’t see is how our docs are much more succinct and equitably distributed than half remembered conversations that happen over and over, with less validation and more disruptions to SMEs' time.</p>
<p>Our docs are not perfect, but too often the cry of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6_eqxh-Qok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many notes</a>!” can be a reflection of a) it is not the quantity, but the structure needs work, b) documentation is most needed when a person is new and <a href="https://ucatt.arizona.edu/news/curse-knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the curse of knowledge</a> can make some content seem redundant or c) it can be upsetting to see your systems more clearly. We bear witness to what is and give voice to what is quietly understood, and that can be an uncomfortable thing.</p>
<p>At the recent Write the Docs conference in Portland, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K6Bz9LM6Uc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yanjie Niu’s talk, “The Power of Two: How Support and Documentation Teams Transform Technical Content Quality,”</a> was an inspiring example of how the roles of technical writers should evolve. It is important for us, and our employers, to see more examples like these. If you are a technical writer with similar positive experiences, I encourage you to share them, as talks or blogs. This will help us build our case and help more of us have career trajectories.</p>
<p>Short term, however, many of us are doing soul searching around what to do next. This is especially true when our superpower, writing great resumes and cover letters, gets drowned out by resumes created by generative AI. There are still opportunities for our voices to punch through, but there are volume issues to contend with.</p>

<p>The Prioritization Matrix, developed by <a href="https://jessicaabel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Abel</a> as part of her Creative Focus course, has served me well when choosing what creative project to do and works for me again as I look for the next (paid) opportunity. Jessica has even used this matrix to decide what fridge to buy.</p>
<p>With Jessica’s permission, I’ve created a version of the matrix tailored towards job search activities. Using this matrix comes in about a quarter of the way through the course, so I’ve created some instructions tailored towards job search to help you get to a basic decision criteria.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my new technical writing blog.</p>
<p>First, a big shout out to the following thought leaders who have encouraged more technical writers to share their knowledge and opinions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://passo.uno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti</a>
<ul>
<li>Terrific human whose blog posts stir conversations and help us build a better vocabulary for what we do.</li>
<li><a href="https://passo.uno/tech-writing-depth-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical writing has a depth issue</a> is a powerful call to action for more of us to step out of the shadows and own our expertise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://thenotboringtechwriter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not-Boring Tech Writer Podcast</a>
<ul>
<li>In particular, <a href="https://thenotboringtechwriter.com/episodes/the-craft-of-technical-writing-with-marcia-riefer-johnston" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The craft of technical writing with Marcia Riefer Johnston</a> talks about the snowballing power of sharing a small tidbit of information and then building on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Write the Docs Slack</a>
<ul>
<li>Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation.</li>
<li>The Slack channel contains a lot of expertise. It's been great to hear all the different voices and it is why I went to my first Write the Docs conference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Write the Docs, Portland (USA)</a>
<ul>
<li>A wonderful annual conference for documentarians (be they technical writers, programmers, managers, project managers, user support agents or wild enthusiasts).</li>
<li>At the conference this year (2025) I shared multiple frameworks with folks and gave a Lightning Talk. These topics will form the basis of my initial blog posts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the coming weeks I'll share various tools and tricks for analysing your docs and getting insights into your users and products. I'll also share some resources for a more holistic approach to the work we do. When we think about content quality, we often focus on the docs themselves, when workplace environments and physical humans need just as much attention.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts, feedback or ideas you'd like me to expand on, you can email me at <a href="mailto:liz@lizargall.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liz@lizargall.com</a> or create an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/lizargall/lizargall.github.io/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository of this website</a>. If issues ever need to be moderated I'll use the <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Write the Docs Code of Conduct</a> as the framework, AKA don't be a jerk.</p>
<p>If you use any of my ideas and would like to share how they're going for you, I'd love to hear from you as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to my fellow documentarians, you make it a pleasure to write for.</p>

<p>Good things,</p>

<p>Bonus art, we do tend to juggle a lot of things!

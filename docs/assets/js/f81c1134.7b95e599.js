It\'s been great to hear all the different voices and it is why I went to my first Write the Docs conference.\\n* [Write the Docs, Portland (USA)](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/)\\n   * A wonderful annual conference for documentarians (be they technical writers, programmers, managers, project managers, user support agents or wild enthusiasts).\\n   * At the conference this year (2025) I shared multiple frameworks with folks and gave a Lightning Talk. These topics will form the basis of my initial blog posts.\\n\\nOver the coming weeks I\'ll share various tools and tricks for analysing your docs and getting insights into your users and products. I\'ll also share some resources for a more holistic approach to the work we do. When we think about content quality, we often focus on the docs themselves, when workplace environments and physical humans need just as much attention.\\n\\nIf you have thoughts, feedback or ideas you\'d like me to expand on, you can email me at liz@lizargall.com or create an issue in the [GitHub repository of this website](https://github.com/lizargall/lizargall.github.io/issues). If issues ever need to be moderated I\'ll use the [Write the Docs Code of Conduct](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/code-of-conduct/) as the framework, AKA don\'t be a jerk.\\n\\nIf you use any of my ideas and would like to share how they\'re going for you, I\'d love to hear from you as well.\\n\\nThanks to my fellow documentarians, you make it a pleasure to write for.\\n\\nIf you\'d like to get an email every time there\'s a blog post, [subscribe to my technical writing mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/520551e04a4d/documentarians-rock). \\n\\nGood things,\\n\\nLiz\\n\\n*liz@lizargall.com*\\n\\n*11 May 2025*"}]}}')}}]);

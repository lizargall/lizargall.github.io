I wanted to write about the power that comes from turning up a little bit at a time consistently. As I attended to the work of blogging regularly it evolved to be a love letter to processes, structures, systems and their interconnections. This essay gives you a tour of philosophies and metaphors that may feel disconnected at first, but all feed into creating meaningful, effective work while avoiding burnout.\\n\\nDue to the nature of this essay, I\'ve only done minimal edits while typing. This essay is a love letter after all, and it wouldn\'t do to over work it!\\n\\n### Let\'s begin\\nOver the last few blog posts, I\'ve shared some resources for mindfully turning up for your docs and for yourself. \\n\\nIf you look at these resources you might get a sense of overwhelm. OMG, there\'s so much to do and I haven\'t done it all! It\'s easy for your mind to shut down and decide, if you can\'t do it all, what\'s the point? \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAll of these resources have evolved over time, through a combination of trial and error, research and reflection. And so it should go with your implementation. All of these structures are there to foster better conversations and give you different ways of focusing your attention through different helpful structures.\\n\\nIf you glance at the templates briefly, perhaps that sparks an idea or irritates you in an interesting direction. When we mindfully observe and work through patterns, templates and philosophies with a curious mind it can enrich many domains in our lives. I\'m a better Aikido practitioner thanks to how deeply I care about technical writing. I am a better technical writer and colleague by thinking about how I can apply Aikido to the workplace.\\n\\n## The joy of mindful practice\\n\\nIn [*Bounce: the Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice*](https://www.matthewsyed.co.uk/book/bounce-the-myth-of-talent-and-the-power-of-practice/), by Matthew Syed, Syed reflects on how so much of what we perceive as talent is practice that we don\'t see. Sometimes we don\'t even see our own practice, because it\'s \\"just fun\\" or we don\'t see how expertise in one domain can contribute to another. \\n\\nIn Bounce, Syed explores how it\'s not just any practice that helps you grow. Syed was the number one table tennis player in the UK for many years and was an Olympian twice. When he goes through his own origin story he explores how a series of happy coincidences created an environment where he was able to practice with pleasure from an early age and then have the chance to train with technical rigor at school. \\n\\nDoing just any old practice won\'t make you an expert. If you practice half-heartedly doing something, 10,000 hours won\'t feel like expertise, it\'ll feel like a chore and you\'ll become an expert at drudging through something with diminished attention. \\n\\nI\'ll never forget watching Richard Sherman, a remarkable American football player (if sadly in the news for the wrong reasons these days), warming up before a game. It was the best part of the whole day. While other people were going through the motions doing warmups to get through warmups, he was giving every motion his full attention. Every lunge, every rotation of his body, committed fully to the exercise and not bouncing out of it before completing the full stretch. His focus and ability to use this \\"simple\\" task to work with every part of his body is a memory I treasure and carry with me into my practices. \\n\\nWhen Richard Sherman warmed up he aligned his consciousness with his body with his activity, filling it with intention and power. It\'s not just how much we practice, it\'s how we practice.\\n\\n## The pleasure and purpose of organizing philosophies\\n\\n[Aikido](https://sanger.umich.edu/news-1-2-19-ema-aikido/) has been a love of mine since I was 19 years old, and I\'ve been with my present dojo for about a decade. When I bow in, I try to empty my mind, splosh out all the stuff that\'s been building in my head. I set an intention to be present for what that practice is and to learn deeply, whether we\'re doing a \\"basic\\" technique or an advanced move. \\n\\nEmptying my head helps me be present for my fellow Aikidoki as they are, not what I think they are. It helps me listen closely to newer folks, their struggles teach me so much about my craft, as new users and new minds can help me learn about my docs. Emptying my head and staying grounded in my practice helps me listen closely to the folks who have been around longer than me, my subject matter experts (SMEs). Sometimes I might be baffled about how they\'re trying to teach me something. If I listen closely and remain open to their teaching I can find out if they\'re actually trying to teach me something else. Sometimes I see how the struggles of old hands are similar to the struggles of newer folks. We can laugh at the commonalities, how we all benefit from returning to the beginning and always working on our foundations.\\n\\nThrough the constraints and structures of practice, it happens at a certain place at a certain time, our techniques have a shared vocabulary and certain people lead the experience, I have an organizational structure to actively learn in. No matter what we do at practice, I\'m doing Aikido with my whole attention and that is satisfying.\\n\\nWhen we mindfully turn up and know we are operating in a helpful structure, we can set aside (or turn down the volume) on a whole range of worries and perfectionisms. The question isn\'t, \\"Am I good enough?\\" The question becomes, \\"Am I doing Aikido?\\" \\n\\nWe can see the value of helpful structures in so many fields and amongst so many people who perform at high levels. We can see these helpful structures in the ways we build communities and interact. \\n\\n### Permaculture design principles\\n\\n[Permaculture](https://permacultureprinciples.com/), a philosophy and practice for sustainable land management and communities, posits the questions such as:\\n* Am I listening to the ecosystem?\\n    * Am I trying to force my will and how \\"things should be\\" onto documents or architecture without working through what that means for that workplace and userbase?\\n* How can I obtain a yield?\\n    * Am I getting caught up in elaborate structures when I should be focused on smaller user stories?\\n* How do I use edges and the marginal? How am I catching and storing energy? Are we paying attention to the correct level of design?\\n    * Do I need to educate people that messy is ok, especially in forming and storming phases?\\n    * Do people feel safe contributing and that mistakes and imperfection are ok?\\n    * Am I getting bogged down in copy editing perfection when that time would be better served working on the big picture?\\n\\n\\n### Diataxis framework\\nPermaculture can then blend into the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which isn\'t about bludgeoning documentation into a specific shape. It\'s a map that helps you articulate natural rhythms that are pleasing. Diataxis can help create clarity around:\\n* The purpose of each nugget of information.\\n* Developing a consistent template for readmes and features.\\n    * I find I apply all of Diataxis on a single page, far more than splitting things out.\\n    * I\'ve found engineers find it easier to align with a template if there is a methodology behind it, it\'s not just me having ideas.\\n* Trust that messy and incomplete is part of the process.\\n    * Permaculture is a valuable framework, but it\'s nice to have a call to authority that says, \\"Things looking bad can be a sign of improvement.\\"\\n* SMEs can find it easier to onboard people and manage the OTT infodump if you tell them their deep understanding has a place.\\n    * I\'ve used Diataxis and the \\"teaching someone to cook\\" metaphor to help SMEs understand that there is a time and place for explanation, but first we need to get folks into the kitchen.\\n    * Saying how-to guides are like recipes has helped SMEs understand when a tutorial is required and when it\'s a how-to. This clear distinction has made it much easier to build trust, as programmers fear being patronizing or being patronized to. Don\'t worry, I wont tell you to wash your hands when it\'s a recipe card!\\n* The best fertilizer is the gardener\'s shadow.\\n    * Ok, that saying is taken from gardening, but at its heart, Diataxis is just a framework for mindfully turning up for your docs and improving a bit here and there. \\n    * It\'s a continual practice, not an end point.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Open source principles and values\\nDiataxis can blend nicely into [open source principles](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/open-source-culture-9-core-principles-and-values) such as do-ocracy, collaboration and self-organization (how you turn up for your part of the garden might be really different to mine, but we both want it to thrive and a shared vocabulary helps). Open Source can invite questions such as:\\n* How are we listening to our communities?\\n* How do we build environments of collaboration and respect?\\n* How do we support the do-ers and make sure we\'re not burning through volunteers?\\n\\n### Agile methodologies\\nOpen source blends nicely into [Agile methodologies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/manifesto), where a few of the questions it asks are:\\n* How are we creating chunks of work that are purposeful?\\n* How are we collaborating cross-functionally and with our customers?\\n* What can we achieve now?\\n* How are we valuing the energy and time of all the individuals that make up the whole?\\n    * As Permaculture would say, \\"Use and value renewable resources and services\\"\\n\\n## Spreadsheets and processes to value your efforts\\nThe [spreadsheets](job-search) I\'ve created should have value if you glance at them. They should have greater value if you use them as a structure.\\n\\nIn Aikido, I know that if I\'ve turned up on the mat and given my focused attention for an hour, I have done good work.\\n\\nIf I spend an hour working on a [search term analysis](search-term-analysis), I will have done good work. I may have improved my docs, gained a greater understanding of user experience or experienced great waves of despair as I encounter places my docs fall short. What matters on a fundamental level is that you\'ve practiced within a supportive framework and have turned up. \\n\\nIf you don\'t have a structure it can be easy to think, \\"What have I done? I\'ve done nothing today!\\" This is especially true if you encounter problems in the docs thanks to your diligence. When you don\'t have a container to hold and witness your work it can be easy to lose perspective. \\n\\n## The map is not the territory\\nVarious helpful structures can help you see your content in new and novel ways. They can disrupt comfortable modes of seeing and get you closer to the experience of a new user. They are helpful maps, but the map is not the territory. \\n\\nMaps can be helpful for pointing out phenomena in our shared physical universe, but they are always incomplete. They have to be, or we\'d be drowned in noise. One map might be full of contour lines and show where dry riverbeds sometimes flow. Another map might crisply and cleanly focus on roads and provide the latest prices at gas stations. \\n\\nNeither map is wrong, they just have different purposes. Sometimes, the most beautiful thing as you explore the territory is to see what seemingly disparate maps have in common. To attend to the work, to gain experience, to think deeply and see how your maps build into a larger story is satisfying.\\n\\n## Media I\'m enjoying\\n- Tara McMullin \\n    - [Breaking The Validation Spiral: A Systems Approach | Essay or Podcast](https://whatworks.fyi/articles/validation-spiral)\\n    - [How to Leverage Enabling Structures to Fulfill Values | Essay or Podcast](https://whatworks.fyi/articles/enabling-structures)\\n- Python Software Foundation (Daniele Procida) [Python Docs Community Workshop: Introduction to Diataxis | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=710uQqIqsWk&t=20s)\\n    - This is a LONG video, but I like how it shows the friendly side to Diataxis that really emphasizes process over destination.\\n    - Tone is so much easier to convey when there are voices and faces!\\n- Huw Richards [PERMACULTURE Explained in 6 Minutes | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRSn-DZTGa4)\\n- Aikido Journal (Josh Gold) [Aikido: A Message and Mission for Our Time | Article](https://aikidojournal.com/2019/11/13/aikido-a-message-and-mission-for-our-times/)\\n- Write the Docs [Colin Loretz - Open Docs, Open Collaboration: Building Better Documentation with Community PRs | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFlGwC7DZqc)\\n\\n### Want to read more blog posts?\\n[Subscribe to my newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/520551e04a4d/documentarians-rock) to be emailed whenever I do an update!"},{"id":"search-term-analysis","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/search-term-analysis","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-05-search.mdx","title":"Introduction to search term analysis","description":"If you want to jump straight straight into Search Term Analysis spreadsheet:","date":"2025-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Templates and Spreadsheets","permalink":"/blog/tags/templates","description":"Blog posts that include templates or spreadsheets you can grab."},{"inline":false,"label":"Friends","permalink":"/blog/tags/friends","description":"Friendship is magic.

Through this approach you can get a clearer understanding of your users and identify the most impactful ways to improve your docs.\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWLHKnbdkBA?si=DTtzfNL2jI2MizF9&amp;start=1058\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nThis article goes into a bit more detail and provides a template for conducting several kinds of search term analysis. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why do a search term analysis?\\nUsers who actually provide feedback are a small percentage of our user base. They are often important users, they\'re the super users who care and will help others use our tools and services. Statistically, however, people who give feedback are outliers.\\n\\nWhen you conduct a search term analysis you can think through many user personas as you come up with terms and get a suite of benefits, including:\\n* Identify content gaps and pain points\\n* Prioritize content based on real-world queries\\n* Interact with your content in fresh new ways helps you refresh your content\\n* Make some of the invisible maintenance work you do more visible\\n    * It\'s one thing to make content improvements as general maintenance, it\'s another thing to make content improvements with a framework!\\n\\n\\n:::note\\nThere are content marketing and sales tools that can help you with some of aspects of search term analysis analysis, but they\'re often expensive and seldom made available to technical writers. Additionally, part of the power of this analysis is the physical process of thinking through and going through user experiences.\\n:::\\n\\n### LLM investigation\\nFor this new spreadsheet, I created a tab exploring how you could analyze user experiences if they ask an LLM questions. I suggest using [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) as it is designed to provide references. It was interesting to think about how a robustly referenced Perplexity output differs from search engine output. LLMs can statistically aggregate relationships, they can provide interesting juxtapositions, but individual topics aren\'t explored with as much depth. LLMs provide an answer, as [Tara McMullin](https://whatworks.fyi/) would say, they prioritize efficiency and authority. LLMs will never fully replace search engines, but when used well LLMs can be a launch pad for more robustly using search engines. \\n\\n## How to do a search term analysis\\nI\'ve put the majority of the instructions in the spreadsheet, so that it can be the source of truth.\\n\\n### Step 1: Set up your spreadsheet and read the instructions\\n\\n- [Create your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydkOg5Zx-FUT8jYJK13C5rYNWByFvpK9Th6o5ZAK8G8/copy)\\n- [Master document, where you can leave comments and provide feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydkOg5Zx-FUT8jYJK13C5rYNWByFvpK9Th6o5ZAK8G8)\\n\\n### Step 2: Decide on your approach \\nOnce you\'ve read through the instructions, decide on your focus. Start with the most pressing needs and potential pain points/unknowns and then iterate. While you could do this as part of a formal [audit process](https://github.com/google/opendocs/blob/main/project_archetypes/audit.md), I recommend starting it as a casual investigation. Try it out, explore the benefits and please yourself before getting too fancy!\\n\\nI recommend starting with a quick Targeted Keyword or Google Autocomplete analysis.\\n\\n### Step 3: Decide when to share your findings\\nUnless there\'s a particular pain point (why can\'t folks find calibration information?), it\'s often better to chew over it, get to know your content via search term analysis over time. You may be surprised by the content improvements and insights you get exploring content in this organic, exploratory manner.\\n\\nAn analysis that fits in around other things might take a month or two. An analysis that focused on some burning questions might take a day or two!\\n\\n### Step 4: Reflect on the process\\nWhat worked what didn\'t? Set a time for when to revisit your content, twice a year can be a helpful cadence. You may wish to schedule an analysis the month before a major announcement, so your content is prepared should there be a sudden surge in interest.\\n\\nIf you\'d like to tell me how it goes, I\'d love to hear about it! I\'d especially love to hear about whether the LLM section is useful. Everything else in the spreadsheet is tried and tested, but that section is a new adventure.

A caption underneath reads \\"Dang brain weasels can make it hard to see!\\"](/img/blog/2025-05-26-neurodivergent.png)\\n## Creating a framework to manage the brain weasels\\n\\nWhenever life doesn\'t go to plan, there is an opportunity to self reflect and find opportunities to learn and grow. This is a useful habit to cultivate and can turn adversity into an alchemical experience. \\n\\nWhat is not helpful, is to look at the data, look at all the variables that go into being a human and come to the conclusion that you are a trash human/need to improve across all the criteria. This is especially challenging when you\'re not even sure what the criteria are, or perhaps the criteria changes as you analyze yourself from different angles.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Enter the Neurodivergent Quality of Life Prioritization (NQLP) Matrix \\n\\nWhile the [Job Search Prioritization Matrix](job-search) helps you think through what sorts of jobs to look for, the [NQLP Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/copy) helps you identify what\'s going well in your life and what improvements you want to prioritize. You get to choose what is important to you and self accept what\'s not a priority right now. You can\'t improve on all the criteria all the time. Maybe, for example, you need to focus on understanding when you\'re sleep deprived and hungry, and that in itself will help your distress tolerance around people being wrong.\\n\\nIf you choose to share your matrix with others it can be a helpful conversation starter. Sometimes people have narrow or stereotyped perceptions of what it means to be Autistic or have ADHD, through the matrix you have more opportunities to show the complexity of who you are. Maybe you\'re an Autistic person who\'s great with change, but oooh, emotional regulation when things are itchy? That might be on a totally different level.\\n\\n### The celebration is just as important as the improvements\\nOne of the reasons quality improvement projects can fail is because they spend too much time focusing on what needs to be improved without adequate celebration of what is going well. Don\'t skimp on celebrating anything that you do well.\\n\\n### A word of caution\\n\\nThis matrix could be a great tool for you to go over with a loved one or even some managers. But, a manager should never expect an employee to work on this matrix. This matrix is emotionally intimate and needs to be driven by the person filling in the matrix, not by an outside person, especially not an outside person with power.\\n\\n### A word of thanks and an invitation\\nThanks to the Write the Docs Portland conference for inspiring this spreadsheet. I created this while thinking about what sort of lightning talk I could do. I ended up doing a completely different lightning talk, but while I was at this conference I showed it to a lot of people. Thanks to everyone who asked questions, suggested extra criteria or laughed at the shared acknowledgements of imperfection. \\"Management of enthusiastic info dump over chat,\\" anyone? This matrix has been enriched by the generosity of many neurodivergent people who shared their stories and challenges. What is easy to one person can\'t be taken for granted by another, and this matrix helps us see ourselves and others more clearly.\\n\\nThis resource was created with neurodivergent folks in mind, if only because neurotypical people seem to be more likely to recognize when they are hungry. That said, I bet this matrix could be useful to any human. To paraphrase Rick Green, \\"ADHD is like height, everyone has some. It\'s just that if you don\'t realize you\'re 10ft tall you might think you\'re just really clumsy and bad with ceiling fans, when no one else has those problems. You might be so convinced you\'re clumsy that you never think to try out for a basketball team.\\"\\n\\nSo, neurotypical or divergent, I encourage you to try out the spreadsheet, and I\'d love to hear how it goes.\\n\\n- [Create your own copy of the NQLP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/copy)\\n  - This link will create your own copy\\n- [Master document, where you can leave comments and provide feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/)\\n\\n## Media I\'m enjoying\\n\\n- Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti\\n  - [How to grow as a technical writer | Essay](https://passo.uno/how-to-grow-senior-tech-writer/)\\n  - [This I remind myself when working with others | Essay](https://passo.uno/tips-working-tech-writers-team/)\\n- Janine Chan, [7 habits of increasingly technical technical writers | Write the Docs | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkpXpvTk6iU)\\n    - Come for the growth mindset, stay for the practical tips on how to be a great colleague.\\n- Valeria Hernandez, [Rethinking the user journey for technical documentation | Essay](https://valeria-writes-docs.super.site/blog/rethinking-the-user-journey-for-technical-documentation)\\n    - I do love a nice template!\\n- Oliver Burkeman [The awkwardness principle: why change rarely feels right | Essay](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/awkwardness)\\n- Ana Akana, [How to put on your face | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f49xeXdFSgc)\\n\\n\\n### Want to read more blog posts?\\n[Subscribe to my newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/520551e04a4d/documentarians-rock) to be emailed whenever I do an update!"},{"id":"job-search","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/job-search","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-19-job-search.mdx","title":"Job search prioritization matrix","description":"Searching for work in 2025","date":"2025-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Friends","permalink":"/blog/tags/friends","description":"Friendship is magic.

And see ourselves more clearly?](/img/blog/2025-05-19-job_prioritization.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## The state of things\\n\\nIt would be an understatement to say that the lives of technical writers have been destabilized by the advent of generative AI. LLMs have made it clear that many people don\u2019t understand what we do and how much technical writers create process and maintain structures. We are more than content creators! \\n\\nTechnical writers can be powerful facilitators and diplomats, bridging gaps between teams, helping more of an organization see each other more clearly. People might see our large doc sites and think \u201ctoo many words!\u201d When what they don\u2019t see is how our docs are much more succinct and equitably distributed than half remembered conversations that happen over and over, with less validation and more disruptions to SMEs\' time.\\n\\nOur docs are not perfect, but too often the cry of \u201c[too many notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6_eqxh-Qok)!\u201d can be a reflection of a) it is not the quantity, but the structure needs work, b) documentation is most needed when a person is new and [the curse of knowledge](https://ucatt.arizona.edu/news/curse-knowledge) can make some content seem redundant or c) it can be upsetting to see your systems more clearly. We bear witness to what is and give voice to what is quietly understood, and that can be an uncomfortable thing.\\n\\nAt the recent Write the Docs conference in Portland, [Yanjie Niu\u2019s talk, \u201cThe Power of Two: How Support and Documentation Teams Transform Technical Content Quality,\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K6Bz9LM6Uc) was an inspiring example of how the roles of technical writers should evolve. It is important for us, and our employers, to see more examples like these. If you are a technical writer with similar positive experiences, I encourage you to share them, as talks or blogs. This will help us build our case and help more of us have career trajectories.\\n\\nShort term, however, many of us are doing soul searching around what to do next. This is especially true when our superpower, writing great resumes and cover letters, gets drowned out by resumes created by generative AI. There are still opportunities for our voices to punch through, but there are volume issues to contend with.\\n\\n## Enter the Prioritization Matrix\\n\\nThe Prioritization Matrix, developed by [Jessica Abel](https://jessicaabel.com/) as part of her Creative Focus course, has served me well when choosing what creative project to do and works for me again as I look for the next (paid) opportunity. Jessica has even used this matrix to decide what fridge to buy.\\n\\nWith Jessica\u2019s permission, I\u2019ve created a version of the matrix tailored towards job search activities. Using this matrix comes in about a quarter of the way through the course, so I\u2019ve created some instructions tailored towards job search to help you get to a basic decision criteria.\\n\\n- [https://tinyurl.com/job-search-template](https://tinyurl.com/job-search-template)\\n  - This link will create your own copy\\n- [https://tinyurl.com/job-search-prioritization](https://tinyurl.com/job-search-prioritization)\\n  - This link will take you to the master document, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\\n\\nWe are impatient humans, so you may want to jump straight into playing with the template, but you\u2019ll get even more out of it if you try out some of the instructions!\\n\\n## Further reading\\n\\n- Open Source, [\u201cFanaka, A handbook for African success in the international software industry.\u201d](https://fanaka.readthedocs.io/)\\n  - Great advice for job seekers in any part of the world.\\n  - [Contributions are welcome](https://fanaka.readthedocs.io/contribute/) (and could look good on a CV)\\n- Bob Watson, \u201c[A look at the past to see the future of technical writing.\u201d](https://docsbydesign.com/2024/03/18/a-look-at-the-past-to-see-the-future-of-technical-writing/)\\n- Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti, \u201c[Technical writing in 2049.\u201d](https://passo.uno/tech-writing-predictions-2049/)\\n- Not Boring Tech Writer, [\u201cKate sounds off on docs hierarchy of needs and how we talk to ourselves.\u201d](https://thenotboringtechwriter.com/episodes/kate-sounds-off-on-docs-hierarchy-of-needs-and-how-we-talk-to-ourselves)\\n  - Go to nine minutes in for recognizing our superpowers and giving ourselves self-compassion.\\n  - We\u2019ll need this self-compassion to be effective advocates for ourselves.\\n- [Yanjie Niu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K6Bz9LM6Uc)\\n    - Write the Docs talk, \u201cThe Power of Two: How Support and Documentation Teams Transform Technical Content Quality.\u201d\\n- Jessica Abel [https://jessicaabel.com/](https://jessicaabel.com/)\\n  - If you have a frustrated creative soul, I recommend checking out her blog, podcasts and workshops.

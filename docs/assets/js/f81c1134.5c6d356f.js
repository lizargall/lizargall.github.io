When we support and inspire each other to do better and deepen our craft we create joyful communities of practice that go beyond creating portfolio pieces. Finding ways to connect and share ideas with folks on similar frequencies can be so joyful when you might be more of the odd duck in mainstream culture!\\n\\nIt\'s been heartening this year to see more people stepping back into, or discovering for the first time, the power of blogging on platforms where they have greater control. The communities we can create can be so much more powerful than algorithms in platforms. There is a DIY power that comes from making more decisions about a space that you create and control. I can say welcome to my house, you can welcome me to your house, and they are different houses. It\'s nice when we can make more with our own hands.\\n\\nWhen we create our own houses there can be a challenge of distribution, of being heard, but at least with our own sites we can have RSS feeds and newsletters to know we\'re reaching the people that have subscribed to listen. We might not be able to escape social media, but we also don\'t need to live there all the time. We can certainly foster other ways of finding each other.\\n\\nIn that spirit CT Smith has created a [webring](https://caseyrfsmith.github.io/webring/). You can go there to read more writers in our space. \\n\\nKevin R. Kuhl has a nice blog post on [what a webring is](https://www.kevinrkuhl.com/blog/2025/11/webring/). He also has a project in the works for publish-on-own-site and syndicate everywhere (POSSE) script for Hugo sites that makes it easier to publish content to some social media platforms. I\'m already using the webring to seek out interesting bloggers to listen to. If you want to add yourself to the webring, just make sure you\'re blogging, not just promoting a portfolio site! \\n\\nIn other news, I had the pleasure and honor of being interviewed by Anurag Shukla in the Docuwiz.io podcast [Creating Strategic, Structured and User-centered Docs](https://docuwiz.substack.com/p/creating-strategic-structured-docs).

It was terrifying, it caused me to doubt everything. It was isolating and it made me worry I\u2019d never be able to hold down a stressful job again.

I love the high stress work I do, and I feel joyfully connected to friends, community and my vocations.\\n\\nThree in a hundred people will experience psychosis, but you wouldn\u2019t know it based on what people are prepared to be open about. Autistic people are more likely to experience psychosis and are more likely to [communicate their distress differently](https://www.autistica.org.uk/what-is-autism/psychosis-and-autism), which means that mental health professionals (not to mention friends and family) might not understand the level of trauma and impact.\\n\\nThis is a technical writing blog. If you\u2019re not neurodivergent, you know people that are. I feel like neurodivergency is pretty neurotypical in technical writing circles! Our people are statistically more likely to go through psychosis, but those that do often brush it off and just get on with things.   \\n\\n![Cartoon transcript.

As [Ramona Hacker points out](https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6_J7FfgWVc?si=gWtKL6b5zx9AesIi), too much empathy can sometimes be a barrier to full emotional intelligence. The noise of so much empathy can drown out too many other parts or give the illusion of strong emotional intelligence when there are aspects that need more work.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBack in the day I may have bluntly asked a therapist, \\"Is it useful for me to know what exact emotions I\'m having? Do they need a label?\\" She said yes, and while it made my neurodivergent brain feel tired and I\'m not quite sure why there have to be quite so many emotions, and aren\'t the a cultural construct anyway? It has been a useful practice to get to know more about specific emotional variables.\\n\\nSo in this blog post, I\'ll list a few emotional intelligence resources I\'ve particularly liked over the years, followed by the regular installment of media I\'m enjoying. \\n\\n## Emotional Intelligence 101\\n\\n### Emotional Intelligence: The #1 ability for leaders\\nI love how Daniel Goleman breaks down the aspects of emotional intelligence in terms of how you know things and how you act, in relation to yourself or others. \\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qmLoJ7-A80?si=spZolSUytQs8bwRu\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n### 6 Steps to Improve Your Emotional Intelligence\\nI love how Ramona Hacker talks about how empathy and emotional intelligence are not the same thing.

They\'ve been working on something for months, maybe years and they just want to display the logical conclusion. It\'s frustrating. I don\'t know how many times I\'ve needed to help engineers understand that a little bit of context, a little bit of grounding information at the top of the doc is not patronizing, it\'s not unnecessarily slowing people down. Context and introductory information helps people (or machines), who are not in the middle of whatever the conversation is, access the meaning of a document. It helps people who might not have the precise words for describing their situation, find their way.\\n\\n![Ngombor + Technical Writing? Presumed context and the challenges of accidental insider baseball ](/img/blog/2025-07-presumed-context.png)\\n*And I must laugh and pause here, and I hope you are laughing too. Most of the world doesn\'t really play baseball, it\'s not global terminology! When it comes to jargon, [inside baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_baseball_(metaphor)) is a little inside baseball!*\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSo here I was, having spent many months working on Ngombor, having been supported and inspired by members of the Write the Docs community, writing content that presumed that my collaborators were the default audience and putting everyone else in the middle of a confusing conversation.\\n\\nWe all always have return to and work on the fundamentals. It\u2019s important to appreciate and listen to the people who give us the kindness of asking questions. We need to use this as doorways to understanding rather than things to react to. I\'m so glad the question was asked. It enabled me to clarify in the Slack channel and write a blog post that goes from how we can make content more accessible to how we can all play a role addressing the damage of colonialism. \\n\\nIf you have questions, or feedback or ideas about how I or Ngombor could do better or how you\'d like to be involved, please drop me a line at either liz@lizargall.com or info@ngombor.com. \\n\\nNow onto some contextual information, here goes...\\n\\nI\'m Liz Argall, I\'m a co-founder of Ngombor. Ngombor is a nonprofit based in Uganda that combines agriculture and tech to make a lasting difference in the West Nile part of Africa. The organization is new, but it builds on 20 year friendship between my father and Vincent Ulargiw. I\'d like to tell you a story about how technical writing and founding a [permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) model farm in Uganda are intimately related.\\n\\n![Ngombor means hope](/img/blog/2025-07-ngombor1.png)\\n\\n\\n## Ngombor\'s origin story\\n### Researching Canonical as I waited for my next interview\\nNgombor Community Development Alliance got its start around January this year. I was in final round interviews with [Canonical](https://canonical.com/) as a Technical Author and thanks to the holidays we were in month three of the process. As part of my research I came across Ngazetungue Muheue\'s Ubuntu Summit talk \\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPP7amqTGFA?si=lyMjkZ2Cq5WMSW_2\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nHis talk is a wonderful and powerful call to action around how Africa needs meaningful partnerships and friendship far more than random chunks of cash, trapped in hustle culture. His talk inspired me to reach out to Vincent Ulargiw, a friend of my father\'s for 20 years. I hadn\'t spoken to Vince since my father had died in 2023. My dad and Vince had become friends after dad helped Vince found a trade school in the DR Congo to support women escaping difficult circumstances or abandonment. My dad paid for their first sewing machines. Vince was across the border in Uganda, so acted as a coordinator, connector and person with a bank account who, unlike people across the border in Congo, was able to safely receive money.\\n\\n![Vince Ulargiw standing in what will will become Ngombor model farm](/img/blog/2025-07-ngombor3.jpg)\\n\\n\\n### Muheue\'s talk needs to be shared and acted upon\\nSo I wrote to Vince and said, \\"I\'m inspired by this YouTube video and if there\'s any way a technical writer could help you folks connect to open source let me know.\\" Vince said, \\"Thank you, what I really want to do is found a permaculture model farm!\\" We got to talking, which distracted me a little bit from preparing for my Canonical interview, but I\u2019m glad it turned out that way. Vince\u2019s plans were massively ambitious and somewhat impossible, but I looked at how I could help him explore the concept and what I could say yes to, rather than what seemed impossible.\\n\\nSo I said, \\"Ok, well to start with, we\'ll need a website, and in terms of empowerment, lets teach folks in Nebbi how to build and maintain the website.\\" This was a starting point that was in my wheelhouse. I was a little overwhelmed by how I was suddenly helping Vince found a permaculture farm. It was not what I had anticipated when I\'d reached out, but I wanted to do what I could.\\n\\nI also knew, from the experience of my father and the call to action from Muheue\'s talk, that turning up for 10 minutes every week was more important than being a flash in the pan. We didn\'t have a clear map when we started out, but I knew that turning up regularly was something I could do.\\n\\nI knew that [from little things big things grow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAONlfoNVuY). I knew that Vince was a great human being, and I knew that the community around him was great as well. I knew that if we were to build a thing we\'d do it a step at a time. I knew we\'d need to talk to a lot of people and get a lot of blank looks, but I knew that if we kept at it, something would happen. I knew that building a website could be done with a text editor and free hosting on GitHub, [unlike the cost of building a farm](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-ngombors-sustainable-future).\\n\\nIn these early stages of, \\"What exactly have I signed up for?!\\" I reached out to the Write the Docs Slack and asked for recommendations for the best path for building a website. I asked static website generator? Wordpress? HTML? We discussed the options and agreed that plain HTML and CSS would be the best approach and would provide a foundation that could build towards programming. \\n\\n![Help us bridge the digital divide](/img/blog/2025-07-ngombor2.png)\\n\\n### How do I teach my rusty HTML asynchronously, remotely, while in the wrong time zone?\\n\\nI was trying to teach Vince HTML remotely over email and the logistics of it (not to mention the time zone differences) made it start to feel a little bit impossible. I thought, if someone in Uganda can teach him GitHub then he can set up his students with that and it will be easier for us to swap files and see what we\'re doing. If we can set it up properly, maybe we can chunk work up into simpler, smaller bite sized pieces that would make it easier for other volunteers to come help us. \\n\\nI thought, there\'s no way I can teach Vince how to use GitHub remotely if we\'re struggling with HTML! So I looked around for local resources. I found out where [PyCon Uganda](https://ug.pycon.org/) was held in 2024 and asked if there was someone who could teach Vince GitHub next time he was in Kampala. \\n\\nFor context Nebbi District, where Ngombor is based, is a day\'s travel to get to Kampala. It\'s not something that\'s accessible to most people in Nebbi, but Vince was going to be in Kampala the following month, so I wondered if someone could spend half an hour showing Vince GitHub. \\n\\n![Map showing Nebbi near the DR Congo border in Northern Uganda, with an arrow showing the long distance to get to Kampala in Central District](/img/blog/nebbi-kampala.png)\\n\\n### PyLadies are a force to be reckoned with!\\nI was hoping for half an hour and maybe a chance to get to know folks for future collaborations. What we got was PyLadies excited to include us in their projects and an invitation to not just go to the next meetup, but be given lunch and shown around Kampala! The meetup was an introduction to data science and it was a remarkable experience. If you go to the [Impact section](https://ngombor.org/#impact) of Ngombor\'s website you\'ll see just how powerful it was to send four people to this meetup. \\n\\nAt this meetup, Ngombor\'s wonderful Chairperson, Laurine Afoyorwoth, touched a computer for the first time. Laurine, a smallholder farmer and Village Health Team Coordinator for Jupuwiny Village, was excited about doing her own data collection/science long hand and encouraging family and community to learn IT. This is a big deal in a place where there can be a big sense of divide between subsistence farmers in rural areas and white collar workers in the city.\\n\\nWe didn\'t get to GitHub, but we got something more. It wasn\'t just working with PyLadies that was impactful. This was Ngombor\'s first project. At the time we didn\'t have a logo, we didn\'t even have a bank account. Having such a useful experience helped demonstrate to ourselves, as well as others, that we were real. \\n\\n![Winny, Cosma and Vince at the PyLadies Meetup](/img/blog/2025-07-ngombor4.jpg)\\n\\n### Places to decompress and discuss things are important\\n\\nAs I continued working on Ngombor, the Write the Docs Slack has been a place to let off steam and ask questions in relevant to documentation or the broader open source world we connect to. When you\'re founding something new, having multiple spaces, mentors and comrades is so important. Even if it\'s just a little note that helps you and get out of your own head. \\n\\nMost recently I got some good guidance when I asked folks for helpful meetup resources. The response was primarily, check out Write the Docs [Starting a Meetup](https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/) article. A simple pointer to a doc, should I be embarrassed that I could have just searched online? No, because the conversation and the focus helped. I\'d previously dismissed this exact resource because Nebbi is far away from Kampala. Who could we get to be as speakers? It seemed so far out of reach.\\n\\nI was tempted to dismiss the resource again, but I wrestled with it. Someone had taken the time to share a resource with me, I wanted to respect their effort. I wrestled with it some more and realized I\'d fallen into colonial thinking. I had it stuck in my head that the big city was where the experts were and that\'s who we needed to bring in.\\n\\nI realized that a lot of what we\'re doing is computer literacy, not fancy programming. There are absolutely local folks that can come and talk about using computers and help folks on their way. It is so easy to accidentally fall into colonial thinking, wherever you are in the world. It\'s so helpful to have fresh inputs that can help you see things differently.\\n\\n![Thank you donors!](/img/blog/2025-07-ngombor5.png)\\n\\n### [Are all animals fish?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQfy_p9ELBw) Is everything technical writing?\\nNgombor is a work in progress, it evolves. So much about starting an organization is about communication, so my skills as a writer have served me more times that I can count. My experience wrestling with large documentation projects helps me triage what is important. If I do get stuck in the weeds, I can at least recognize it and give myself a kind smile and a laugh.\\n\\nOne thing I love about technical writing is how it makes more of the world more accessible to more people. When it\'s in documentation it doesn\'t depend on finding out who holds the lore and how they like their coffee! With good technical writing people should feel invited and welcomed into participation, not feel like they have to prove themselves to gate keepers. I like to say documentation is a human rights issue. We all have a right to be able to participate without currying favor.\\n\\nTechnical writing is about creating empowering spaces that support others achieve their goals. Technical writing is about being there for people when they\'re frazzled and annoyed and just want to get back to playing the game. \\n\\nThe philosophies and skills of technical writing have helped me co-found Ngombor. With the help of lots of different folks around the globe we are enabling a impactful, empowering, community owned and led difference in Uganda.\\n\\n![Close up of two seedlings, prior to being planted](/img/blog/2025-07-ngombor-seedlings.png)\\n\\n### If you\'re not already helping folks in Africa, maybe dabble your toes in the water by helping us?\\n\\nAfrica has been through some pretty horrible stuff thanks to colonialism, and I think it\'s good for the soul to help out in a way that\'s meaningful for you. Africa is not a big monolith you have to save. It\'s a place full of different countries, cultures, spaces and people where your attention can help.\\n\\n Ngombor is a nonprofit based in Uganda that combines agriculture and tech to make a lasting difference in the West Nile part of Africa. The organization is new, but it builds on 20 year friendship between [my father](https://dennis.argall.info/about/about-dennis/) and Vincent Ulargiw. The combination of old and new means that your ability to effect change through donations is powerful. What folks have been able to do with the scantest of resources has been humbling, and we can do so much more.\\n\\n Whether you heed [Ngazetungue Muheue\'s challenge](https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPP7amqTGFA?si=lyMjkZ2Cq5WMSW_2) by connecting or reconnecting with other worthy organizations and individuals in Africa or dip your toes in the water by giving a little to us, it is a rewarding and satisfying thing to do. Muheue\'s call to action can feel like a lot if you\'ve never collaborated with folks in Africa or haven\'t collaborated with people in rural and remote areas. \\n \\n Most people date a little before they settle into something sustained. Unfortunately through the tyrannies of distance and disadvantage, most people don\'t have a chance to try out light levels of engagement that aren\'t in themselves tied up in colonialism (maybe support community led awesomeness rather than \\"save\\" a child?).\\n\\n[Our GoFundMe launched](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-ngombors-sustainable-future) this week and I\'m so delighted by it. I encourage you to [check it out](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-ngombors-sustainable-future), try us out!

It\'s a term that\'s been used for some decades when critiquing literature and has been adopted by autistic communities to refer to our tendencies to excitedly enthuse on a topic.\\n\\nDocumentarians (aka technical writers, content champions and word nerds) are prone to this trait. In some ways technical writing is an ongoing wrestling match with infodumping as we take on vast amounts of information, process and subject matter expertise and transform it into content that can be used and understood with greater ease. \\n\\nIn an increasingly remote world, our non-technical writing colleagues can find our facility for writing things down a little bit overwhelming. It can be especially frustrating for technical writing when even asking questions can trigger overwhelm in others as it floods their brain with new angles and questions. We can feel stuck in a bind where we\'re simultaneously told to ask questions, but also please don\'t communicate so much! \\n\\nThis is why when I was putting together the [Neurodivergent Quality of Life Prioritization Matrix](https://lizargall.github.io/blog/neurodivergent) management of over enthusiastic infodump over chat was one of the first criteria I listed.\\n\\nIn this blog post I share some tips and tricks I find helpful, as well as some advice from fellow Write the Docs peers. We\'ll never get it perfect, but perfect is never the point.\\n\\n\\n![thingswithout.com cartoon, Thing 1: does practice make perfect? Thing 2: no. Things 2: practice can be much more interesting. Words float in the air as the Things dance, adaptability, resilience, fluidity, new questions](/img/blog/2025-07-comic-569-perfect.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## It\'s hard when we \\"think with our fingers!\\"\\nI like to \\"think with my fingers,\\" to have a conversation in written words. In many ways, that\'s what I\'m doing now. This trait can sometimes get us into trouble in group chat.\\n\\nWho else has had the following situation? Someone says (writes) something, it sparks an idea. You get excited. You reply, either in an enormous single reply wall of text, or in a series of excited smaller replies. Either way, the virtual room falls silent, and you think, \\"oh no, I\'ve done it again.\\" \\n\\nIt happens to everyone and it\'s a normal, natural state of things. It\'s how much and to what degree. To paraphrase [Rick Green](https://www.patreon.com/c/RickGreenPatreon/posts), infodump in chat is like height. Everyone has some, but if you\'re 10 feet tall you\'re going to have a lot more problems with ceiling fans and walking into rooms. \\n\\nTo extend the metaphor further, you might have great difficulty in normal rooms, but in the right environment you can excel. Inside at a crowded friends birthday party, you\'ll need to squeeze yourself down a bit, so you don\'t stand on people. Meanwhile, on the basketball court you might have a thrilling time as you lope around with other athletes. \\n\\nJust grimly telling yourself, \\"I just need to do better,\\" only gets you so far when you\'re trying to operate in multiple spaces. By the end of this blog post you should have (or be reminded of) a few more strategies, so you\'re not just trying to white-knuckle yourself into being smaller.\\n\\n## Document workplace operations\\n\\nIdeally, work with your team to create or update a [Teams Working Agreement](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/working-agreements), you\'ll all get a lot of benefit from the process and it\'s good to check in with it. If there\'s resistance to creating such a thing you can still document team guidelines in a formal or informal playbook.\\n\\nIt\'s also helpful to create a [Personal User Manual](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/personal-user-manuals), and the nice thing about a Personal User Manual is that you don\'t need whole of team buy in to just do it for yourself. I\'ve linked to some Atlassian tutorials for creating agreements and the manual as I like how they approach things, but these processes are completely platform agnostic.\\n\\n## Find your basketball courts\\nPent up energy needs go somewhere. If you have an active brain wrestling with ideas and questions, find appropriate solo and human outlets. \\n\\n### Journal\\nFor real! I resisted this for a long time, especially as I had a historical tendency to spiral into negative thought patterns when I did journal. Then I realized that journalling was a great way to practice conversations with other people. I could do a lot of imaginary back and forth in my journal that historically I might have done in chat.\\n\\nMy journalling these days is predominantly to do lists, exploring ideas (such as the first draft of this blog post) and imagining conversations. It\'s great for processing conversations after the fact as well, I get to have my \\"and another thing!\\"... and sometimes as I explore the conversation further, without that pesky other human to annoy me, I can see their side of the story more clearly!\\n\\nWhen I was a reluctant journaller I set myself the goal of 10 minutes journalling at any time of the day. These days it\'s often half an hour in the morning, half an hour in the evening, plus check ins and noodlings through the day. 10 minutes any time of the day is still my gold standard. I find it\'s important to have a really small minimum standard and feel good when I achieve it. Then it can feel like a rewarding time to settle your thoughts, rather than a big obligation.\\n\\nI find it useful to have structured time to journal as well as having a book close to hand when I want to infodump in spaces where that\'s not a welcome activity. Right now I\'m using [graph/college ruled composition books](https://www.officesupply.com/school-supplies/student-teacher-supplies/basic-school-supplies/notebooks/composition-book-college-graph-ruled-gray-white-sheets/p785218.html), so I can have stream of consciousness at the bottom and to do lists on grid paper at the top.\\n\\n### Colleagues who get you\\nSee if there are colleagues on a similar wavelength to you that you can infodump with, either in person or over chat. It can be handy to have a regular meetup as well where you can let off steam. Establish some clear ground rules to help things flow, such as:\\n* Chat is asynchronous, timely replies are not an expectation\\n* It\'s ok not to reply at all\\n* Some content, cool links and so on might not be read at all.\\n\\nWe might assume people have these implied rules, but it\'s still nice to make it explicit. We are process wonks after all!\\n\\n### Peers who get you\\nFind other online communities where you can share some of your thoughts and explorations (while scrubbing off details where necessary). The [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) is a good place to start with. Go for spaces that feel expansive and can help you find solutions. As a general rule, try to find spaces where you generally feel better afterwards, rather than stuck in a despairing spiral. \\n\\n## Organize your thoughts \\nWhen in doubt draft somewhere that is not the chat, revise, then post!\\n\\n### Use meeting agendas to capture questions\\nI last week\'s article I wrote about the value of [writing agendas and minutes](minutes). Meeting agendas are a great place to capture questions that aren\'t time bound. You can use the [1:1 meeting template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjiFKMgSRaDVwiNBztgkKT8pPIb7hqonFmVrhSFcpzI/) I created, update the agenda in the calendar invitation, or update a task/ticket associated with the meeting\\n\\n### Use tasks/tickets to capture thoughts\\nIt doesn\'t matter whether you use Jira, ADO, Zendesk or some in-house solution, use the project management tools in your workplace to capture your thoughts and organize them. Use tags or columns to identify how mature the idea is and how you\'ll circle back to them. Backlog grooming can be a handy way to sort through what\'s a fun distraction and what\'s really important. \\n\\nA lot of people treat tasks as stubs, but you can use the comments and details section to great effect.\\n\\n### Create an enormous document!\\n\\nWhen I\'m onboarding to a new project or feature, I create an enormous document. I dump all my stream of consciousness into it, all my questions, all my ideas, all the requests and projects. As I get to know the team I start to refine the document. I use headers and sub-headers to group ideas. \\n\\nI then have a great document I can go over with my leads. They can see what I\'m thinking, how I\'m seeing the situation. From there we can prioritize and triage the work. Solo technical writers are often thrown into the thick of things and I\'ve found this strategy very helpful. It\'s basically building my own roadmap on the fly.\\n\\n\\n### Work with a coach\\nBrain coaches can be as amazing or meh as a physical coach. There are ones that specialize in different types of neurodiversity and nerderies. If you don\'t identify as neurodiverse but despair of finding a therapist who \\"gets IT,\\" try looking for a therapist who has lots of experience working with autistic adults. There are lots of autistic folks in IT, so they\'ll likely be more familiar with the wild worlds technical writers can inhabit.\\n\\nBrain coaches have many different specializations and labels, and we all have slightly different goals. Diversity in goals means diversity in coaches, just like there are some folks training for an ultra-marathon, others want to train in Aikido, and some have robust knees enough to play Ultimate Frisbee! Some coaches will suit you, some won\'t.\\n\\n## You\'re not alone!\\nI asked people in the [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) community what strategies they had, and here\'s some great advice and solidarity.\\n\\n### [Lisa Clarke](https://lisaclarke.net/hello.html)\\nI have experienced feeling like I am spamming the group, even if everything I have to say is relevant and potentially useful. It\'s hard to know if a feeling like that is in your head, or if your coworkers really are thinking, \\"oh here she goes again with the long messages with too many details that I don\'t feel like reading\\"\\n\\nAs for how to combat that? I tend to pre-write what I want to say in a text editor, and then ruthlessly simplify it before posting. I try to embrace bullet points and eschew walls of text. I have to work to be more to-the-point in my communication, because my default mode is \\"super wordy\\".\\n\\nIn other words, I try to apply the same strategies to group messaging as I do to making my docs more readable.\\n\\n### [Tim McMackin](https://timothymcmack.in/portfolio/)\\nYeah, I\'ve been called out on this. I\'m one of the only remote employees, and we\'ve been asked to do more discussions in private channels (as opposed to DMs) so I post a lot in slack. The only way I\'ve been able to slow down is to spend more time doing research on my own and exhaust independent research before asking questions, even if it costs me time. I don\'t really like that but maybe it will build some more skills over time.\\n\\n### Stacy Ford\\nI do a lot of research before asking questions. And tend to type then pause and edit.\\nFor work, that is. For more chatty things, like this, you see me typing things like this comment, where I add addendums and don\'t edit more.\\n\\nBut with work-related chat, I have found I am more successful if I research a lot then come in with a question and my thought as to what the answer might be. And I will restate things to developers when they info-dump on me.\\n\\nI also sometimes use Jira cases as notebooks and will have a running comment going there where I info-dump and then edit before I hit save, so I can keep the notes connected to the case.\\n\\n### Jill Koglatis\\nIn our team we had at different points (in different team setups) communications workshops. Those were not meant to teach any techniques, but to understand the team mates better. So cultural background, information preferences etc. Very eye-opening for everyone.

Minutes are recordings of decisions and discussions that occurred during a meeting. Done right, they are powerful and meaningful. As a technical writer, I\'ve often used an agenda and minutes to drive decision making, make next steps clear and to manage my own [enthusiastic use of workplace chat](neurodivergent)! \\n\\nI have two strong opinions (aka hot takes? but is it really hot?). One is that technical writers have a vested interested in good meeting minutes and should just start writing them if the minutes are falling short. \\n\\n![Comic transcript. Liz: So what did we decide? As yet unnamed character: I don\'t know, but there sure were a lot of opinions!](/img/blog/2025-07-minutes-matter.png) \x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nI know some writers resist getting too close to things that might be project management, but at the end of the day we are word nerds who care about process. Where meeting minutes are not attended to it effectively it is to our benefit to make them happen and improve upon them. \\n\\nMy second strong opinion is that meeting minutes are generally poorly done, when they\'re done at all. Meeting minutes should be a very active part of the process, not a passive summary after the fact. \\n\\nA transcript of who said what or who had what different opinion doesn\u2019t matter unless it\u2019s tied to an action item (X will investigate Y). One of the most valuable things I learned when doing nonprofit governance training back in the day is that when a board makes a decision, it makes the decision. It doesn\'t matter if someone objected, they are bound by that decision. They may ask for something to be noted, however, that has no legal standing if your board gets sued. If a board makes a decision and you think it\'s unlawful, you will be held accountable to that decision unless you resign from the board! Saying, \\"But I said I objected! Look in the minutes!\\" does not protect you in any way.\\n\\nThere are times when it can be helpful to note an objection, creating a historical record, making sure something important gets heard, but it is just that. While most of us don\'t live with such extremes of decision making, but it is a helpful to keep in mind if you\u2019re bogged down in who exactly said what.\\n\\nAI has created new capabilities for transcribing meeting and creating summaries that can supplement to a well governed meeting (if company policy allows it), not stand alone. Minutes are a process as much as a record.\\n\\nActively take minutes during a meeting to find out what is meaningful. This will make the meetings more focused and helps to avoid circular conversations. Try:\\n* I want to get clear for the minutes, is the decision x?\\n* Shall we record that we\'ve considered y solution but have decided against it? That way we\'ve got it documented? Do we need to stick with this for now, but set a time to re-evaluate in 6 months?\\n* Shall we have an action item for Z to research the top three options and report back next meeting?\\n* We\'ve got four more items on the agenda, do we want to defer those items for later? Can we wrap up here?\\n\\nWhen emotions get high, it can be helpful to circle back to just needing to document things. You can be a neutral party, just trying to get clarity. It can be a useful way for participants to consider what it is they need to have heard, is it venting? Is it an action item? have we reached a decision but still awkwardly circling it? \\n\\nI\'ve created a shareable template for how I like to organize 1:1 meetings. I\'ve found this helpful professionally as well as when working with volunteers. In my spare time I\'m the co-founder of [Ngombor Community Development Alliance](https://ngombor.org).

This essay gives you a tour of philosophies and metaphors that may feel disconnected at first, but all feed into creating meaningful, effective work while avoiding burnout.\\n\\nDue to the nature of this essay, I\'ve only done minimal edits while typing. This essay is a love letter after all, and it wouldn\'t do to over work it!\\n\\n### Let\'s begin\\nOver the last few blog posts, I\'ve shared some resources for mindfully turning up for your docs and for yourself. \\n\\nIf you look at these resources you might get a sense of overwhelm. OMG, there\'s so much to do and I haven\'t done it all! It\'s easy for your mind to shut down and decide, if you can\'t do it all, what\'s the point? \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAll of these resources have evolved over time, through a combination of trial and error, research and reflection. And so it should go with your implementation. All of these structures are there to foster better conversations and give you different ways of focusing your attention through different helpful structures.\\n\\nIf you glance at the templates briefly, perhaps that sparks an idea or irritates you in an interesting direction. When we mindfully observe and work through patterns, templates and philosophies with a curious mind it can enrich many domains in our lives. I\'m a better Aikido practitioner thanks to how deeply I care about technical writing. I am a better technical writer and colleague by thinking about how I can apply Aikido to the workplace.\\n\\n## The joy of mindful practice\\n\\nIn [*Bounce: the Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice*](https://www.matthewsyed.co.uk/book/bounce-the-myth-of-talent-and-the-power-of-practice/), by Matthew Syed, Syed reflects on how so much of what we perceive as talent is practice that we don\'t see. Sometimes we don\'t even see our own practice, because it\'s \\"just fun\\" or we don\'t see how expertise in one domain can contribute to another. \\n\\nIn Bounce, Syed explores how it\'s not just any practice that helps you grow. Syed was the number one table tennis player in the UK for many years and was an Olympian twice. When he goes through his own origin story he explores how a series of happy coincidences created an environment where he was able to practice with pleasure from an early age and then have the chance to train with technical rigor at school. \\n\\nDoing just any old practice won\'t make you an expert. If you practice half-heartedly doing something, 10,000 hours won\'t feel like expertise, it\'ll feel like a chore and you\'ll become an expert at drudging through something with diminished attention. \\n\\nI\'ll never forget watching Richard Sherman, a remarkable American football player (if sadly in the news for the wrong reasons these days), warming up before a game. It was the best part of the whole day. While other people were going through the motions doing warmups to get through warmups, he was giving every motion his full attention. Every lunge, every rotation of his body, committed fully to the exercise and not bouncing out of it before completing the full stretch. His focus and ability to use this \\"simple\\" task to work with every part of his body is a memory I treasure and carry with me into my practices. \\n\\nWhen Richard Sherman warmed up he aligned his consciousness with his body with his activity, filling it with intention and power. It\'s not just how much we practice, it\'s how we practice.\\n\\n## The pleasure and purpose of organizing philosophies\\n\\n[Aikido](https://sanger.umich.edu/news-1-2-19-ema-aikido/) has been a love of mine since I was 19 years old, and I\'ve been with my present dojo for about a decade. When I bow in, I try to empty my mind, splosh out all the stuff that\'s been building in my head. I set an intention to be present for what that practice is and to learn deeply, whether we\'re doing a \\"basic\\" technique or an advanced move. \\n\\nEmptying my head helps me be present for my fellow Aikidoki as they are, not what I think they are. It helps me listen closely to newer folks, their struggles teach me so much about my craft, as new users and new minds can help me learn about my docs. Emptying my head and staying grounded in my practice helps me listen closely to the folks who have been around longer than me, my subject matter experts (SMEs). Sometimes I might be baffled about how they\'re trying to teach me something. If I listen closely and remain open to their teaching I can find out if they\'re actually trying to teach me something else. Sometimes I see how the struggles of old hands are similar to the struggles of newer folks. We can laugh at the commonalities, how we all benefit from returning to the beginning and always working on our foundations.\\n\\nThrough the constraints and structures of practice, it happens at a certain place at a certain time, our techniques have a shared vocabulary and certain people lead the experience, I have an organizational structure to actively learn in. No matter what we do at practice, I\'m doing Aikido with my whole attention and that is satisfying.\\n\\nWhen we mindfully turn up and know we are operating in a helpful structure, we can set aside (or turn down the volume) on a whole range of worries and perfectionisms. The question isn\'t, \\"Am I good enough?\\" The question becomes, \\"Am I doing Aikido?\\" \\n\\nWe can see the value of helpful structures in so many fields and amongst so many people who perform at high levels. We can see these helpful structures in the ways we build communities and interact. \\n\\n### Permaculture design principles\\n\\n[Permaculture](https://permacultureprinciples.com/), a philosophy and practice for sustainable land management and communities, posits the questions such as:\\n* Am I listening to the ecosystem?\\n    * Am I trying to force my will and how \\"things should be\\" onto documents or architecture without working through what that means for that workplace and userbase?\\n* How can I obtain a yield?\\n    * Am I getting caught up in elaborate structures when I should be focused on smaller user stories?\\n* How do I use edges and the marginal? How am I catching and storing energy? Are we paying attention to the correct level of design?\\n    * Do I need to educate people that messy is ok, especially in forming and storming phases?\\n    * Do people feel safe contributing and that mistakes and imperfection are ok?\\n    * Am I getting bogged down in copy editing perfection when that time would be better served working on the big picture?\\n\\n\\n### Diataxis framework\\nPermaculture can then blend into the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which isn\'t about bludgeoning documentation into a specific shape. It\'s a map that helps you articulate natural rhythms that are pleasing. Diataxis can help create clarity around:\\n* The purpose of each nugget of information.\\n* Developing a consistent template for readmes and features.\\n    * I find I apply all of Diataxis on a single page, far more than splitting things out.\\n    * I\'ve found engineers find it easier to align with a template if there is a methodology behind it, it\'s not just me having ideas.\\n* Trust that messy and incomplete is part of the process.\\n    * Permaculture is a valuable framework, but it\'s nice to have a call to authority that says, \\"Things looking bad can be a sign of improvement.\\"\\n* SMEs can find it easier to onboard people and manage the OTT infodump if you tell them their deep understanding has a place.\\n    * I\'ve used Diataxis and the \\"teaching someone to cook\\" metaphor to help SMEs understand that there is a time and place for explanation, but first we need to get folks into the kitchen.\\n    * Saying how-to guides are like recipes has helped SMEs understand when a tutorial is required and when it\'s a how-to. This clear distinction has made it much easier to build trust, as programmers fear being patronizing or being patronized to. Don\'t worry, I wont tell you to wash your hands when it\'s a recipe card!\\n* The best fertilizer is the gardener\'s shadow.\\n    * Ok, that saying is taken from gardening, but at its heart, Diataxis is just a framework for mindfully turning up for your docs and improving a bit here and there. \\n    * It\'s a continual practice, not an end point.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Open source principles and values\\nDiataxis can blend nicely into [open source principles](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/open-source-culture-9-core-principles-and-values) such as do-ocracy, collaboration and self-organization (how you turn up for your part of the garden might be really different to mine, but we both want it to thrive and a shared vocabulary helps). Open Source can invite questions such as:\\n* How are we listening to our communities?\\n* How do we build environments of collaboration and respect?\\n* How do we support the do-ers and make sure we\'re not burning through volunteers?\\n\\n### Agile methodologies\\nOpen source blends nicely into [Agile methodologies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/manifesto), where a few of the questions it asks are:\\n* How are we creating chunks of work that are purposeful?\\n* How are we collaborating cross-functionally and with our customers?\\n* What can we achieve now?\\n* How are we valuing the energy and time of all the individuals that make up the whole?\\n    * As Permaculture would say, \\"Use and value renewable resources and services\\"\\n\\n## Spreadsheets and processes to value your efforts\\nThe [spreadsheets](job-search) I\'ve created should have value if you glance at them. They should have greater value if you use them as a structure.\\n\\nIn Aikido, I know that if I\'ve turned up on the mat and given my focused attention for an hour, I have done good work.\\n\\nIf I spend an hour working on a [search term analysis](search-term-analysis), I will have done good work. I may have improved my docs, gained a greater understanding of user experience or experienced great waves of despair as I encounter places my docs fall short. What matters on a fundamental level is that you\'ve practiced within a supportive framework and have turned up. \\n\\nIf you don\'t have a structure it can be easy to think, \\"What have I done? I\'ve done nothing today!\\" This is especially true if you encounter problems in the docs thanks to your diligence. When you don\'t have a container to hold and witness your work it can be easy to lose perspective. \\n\\n## The map is not the territory\\nVarious helpful structures can help you see your content in new and novel ways. They can disrupt comfortable modes of seeing and get you closer to the experience of a new user. They are helpful maps, but the map is not the territory. \\n\\nMaps can be helpful for pointing out phenomena in our shared physical universe, but they are always incomplete. They have to be, or we\'d be drowned in noise. One map might be full of contour lines and show where dry riverbeds sometimes flow.

Through this approach you can get a clearer understanding of your users and identify the most impactful ways to improve your docs.\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWLHKnbdkBA?si=DTtzfNL2jI2MizF9&amp;start=1058\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nThis article goes into a bit more detail and provides a template for conducting several kinds of search term analysis. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why do a search term analysis?\\nUsers who actually provide feedback are a small percentage of our user base. They are often important users, they\'re the super users who care and will help others use our tools and services. Statistically, however, people who give feedback are outliers.\\n\\nWhen you conduct a search term analysis you can think through many user personas as you come up with terms and get a suite of benefits, including:\\n* Identify content gaps and pain points\\n* Prioritize content based on real-world queries\\n* Interact with your content in fresh new ways helps you refresh your content\\n* Make some of the invisible maintenance work you do more visible\\n    * It\'s one thing to make content improvements as general maintenance, it\'s another thing to make content improvements with a framework!\\n\\n\\n:::note\\nThere are content marketing and sales tools that can help you with some of aspects of search term analysis analysis, but they\'re often expensive and seldom made available to technical writers. Additionally, part of the power of this analysis is the physical process of thinking through and going through user experiences.\\n:::\\n\\n### LLM investigation\\nFor this new spreadsheet, I created a tab exploring how you could analyze user experiences if they ask an LLM questions. I suggest using [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) as it is designed to provide references. It was interesting to think about how a robustly referenced Perplexity output differs from search engine output. LLMs can statistically aggregate relationships, they can provide interesting juxtapositions, but individual topics aren\'t explored with as much depth. LLMs provide an answer, as [Tara McMullin](https://whatworks.fyi/) would say, they prioritize efficiency and authority. LLMs will never fully replace search engines, but when used well LLMs can be a launch pad for more robustly using search engines. \\n\\n## How to do a search term analysis\\nI\'ve put the majority of the instructions in the spreadsheet, so that it can be the source of truth.\\n\\n### Step 1: Set up your spreadsheet and read the instructions\\n\\n- [Create your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydkOg5Zx-FUT8jYJK13C5rYNWByFvpK9Th6o5ZAK8G8/copy)\\n- [Master document, where you can leave comments and provide feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydkOg5Zx-FUT8jYJK13C5rYNWByFvpK9Th6o5ZAK8G8)\\n\\n### Step 2: Decide on your approach \\nOnce you\'ve read through the instructions, decide on your focus. Start with the most pressing needs and potential pain points/unknowns and then iterate. While you could do this as part of a formal [audit process](https://github.com/google/opendocs/blob/main/project_archetypes/audit.md), I recommend starting it as a casual investigation. Try it out, explore the benefits and please yourself before getting too fancy!\\n\\nI recommend starting with a quick Targeted Keyword or Google Autocomplete analysis.\\n\\n### Step 3: Decide when to share your findings\\nUnless there\'s a particular pain point (why can\'t folks find calibration information?), it\'s often better to chew over it, get to know your content via search term analysis over time. You may be surprised by the content improvements and insights you get exploring content in this organic, exploratory manner.\\n\\nAn analysis that fits in around other things might take a month or two. An analysis that focused on some burning questions might take a day or two!\\n\\n### Step 4: Reflect on the process\\nWhat worked what didn\'t? Set a time for when to revisit your content, twice a year can be a helpful cadence. You may wish to schedule an analysis the month before a major announcement, so your content is prepared should there be a sudden surge in interest.\\n\\nIf you\'d like to tell me how it goes, I\'d love to hear about it! I\'d especially love to hear about whether the LLM section is useful. Everything else in the spreadsheet is tried and tested, but that section is a new adventure.

This is a useful habit to cultivate and can turn adversity into an alchemical experience. \\n\\nWhat is not helpful, is to look at the data, look at all the variables that go into being a human and come to the conclusion that you are a trash human/need to improve across all the criteria. This is especially challenging when you\'re not even sure what the criteria are, or perhaps the criteria changes as you analyze yourself from different angles.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Enter the Neurodivergent Quality of Life Prioritization (NQLP) Matrix \\n\\nWhile the [Job Search Prioritization Matrix](job-search) helps you think through what sorts of jobs to look for, the [NQLP Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/copy) helps you identify what\'s going well in your life and what improvements you want to prioritize. You get to choose what is important to you and self accept what\'s not a priority right now. You can\'t improve on all the criteria all the time. Maybe, for example, you need to focus on understanding when you\'re sleep deprived and hungry, and that in itself will help your distress tolerance around people being wrong.\\n\\nIf you choose to share your matrix with others it can be a helpful conversation starter. Sometimes people have narrow or stereotyped perceptions of what it means to be Autistic or have ADHD, through the matrix you have more opportunities to show the complexity of who you are. Maybe you\'re an Autistic person who\'s great with change, but oooh, emotional regulation when things are itchy? That might be on a totally different level.\\n\\n### The celebration is just as important as the improvements\\nOne of the reasons quality improvement projects can fail is because they spend too much time focusing on what needs to be improved without adequate celebration of what is going well. Don\'t skimp on celebrating anything that you do well.\\n\\n### A word of caution\\n\\nThis matrix could be a great tool for you to go over with a loved one or even some managers. But, a manager should never expect an employee to work on this matrix. This matrix is emotionally intimate and needs to be driven by the person filling in the matrix, not by an outside person, especially not an outside person with power.\\n\\n### A word of thanks and an invitation\\nThanks to the Write the Docs Portland conference for inspiring this spreadsheet. I created this while thinking about what sort of lightning talk I could do. I ended up doing a completely different lightning talk, but while I was at this conference I showed it to a lot of people. Thanks to everyone who asked questions, suggested extra criteria or laughed at the shared acknowledgements of imperfection. \\"Management of enthusiastic info dump over chat,\\" anyone? This matrix has been enriched by the generosity of many neurodivergent people who shared their stories and challenges. What is easy to one person can\'t be taken for granted by another, and this matrix helps us see ourselves and others more clearly.\\n\\nThis resource was created with neurodivergent folks in mind, if only because neurotypical people seem to be more likely to recognize when they are hungry. That said, I bet this matrix could be useful to any human. To paraphrase Rick Green, \\"ADHD is like height, everyone has some. It\'s just that if you don\'t realize you\'re 10ft tall you might think you\'re just really clumsy and bad with ceiling fans, when no one else has those problems. You might be so convinced you\'re clumsy that you never think to try out for a basketball team.\\"\\n\\nSo, neurotypical or divergent, I encourage you to try out the spreadsheet, and I\'d love to hear how it goes.\\n\\n- [Create your own copy of the NQLP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/copy)\\n  - This link will create your own copy\\n- [Master document, where you can leave comments and provide feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/)\\n\\n## Media I\'m enjoying\\n\\n- Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti\\n  - [How to grow as a technical writer | Essay](https://passo.uno/how-to-grow-senior-tech-writer/)\\n  - [This I remind myself when working with others | Essay](https://passo.uno/tips-working-tech-writers-team/)\\n- Janine Chan, [7 habits of increasingly technical technical writers | Write the Docs | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkpXpvTk6iU)\\n    - Come for the growth mindset, stay for the practical tips on how to be a great colleague.\\n- Valeria Hernandez, [Rethinking the user journey for technical documentation | Essay](https://valeria-writes-docs.super.site/blog/rethinking-the-user-journey-for-technical-documentation)\\n    - I do love a nice template!\\n- Oliver Burkeman, [The awkwardness principle: why change rarely feels right | Essay](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/awkwardness)\\n- Ana Akana, [How to put on your face | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f49xeXdFSgc)\\n\\n\\n### Want to read more blog posts?\\n[Subscribe to my newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/520551e04a4d/documentarians-rock) to be emailed whenever I do an update!"},{"id":"job-search","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/job-search","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-19-job-search.mdx","title":"Job search prioritization matrix","description":"Searching for work in 2025","date":"2025-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Friends","permalink":"/blog/tags/friends","description":"Friendship is magic.

LLMs have made it clear that many people don\u2019t understand what we do and how much technical writers create process and maintain structures. We are more than content creators! \\n\\nTechnical writers can be powerful facilitators and diplomats, bridging gaps between teams, helping more of an organization see each other more clearly. People might see our large doc sites and think \u201ctoo many words!\u201d When what they don\u2019t see is how our docs are much more succinct and equitably distributed than half remembered conversations that happen over and over, with less validation and more disruptions to SMEs\' time.\\n\\nOur docs are not perfect, but too often the cry of \u201c[too many notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6_eqxh-Qok)!\u201d can be a reflection of a) it is not the quantity, but the structure needs work, b) documentation is most needed when a person is new and [the curse of knowledge](https://ucatt.arizona.edu/news/curse-knowledge) can make some content seem redundant or c) it can be upsetting to see your systems more clearly. We bear witness to what is and give voice to what is quietly understood, and that can be an uncomfortable thing.\\n\\nAt the recent Write the Docs conference in Portland, [Yanjie Niu\u2019s talk, \u201cThe Power of Two: How Support and Documentation Teams Transform Technical Content Quality,\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K6Bz9LM6Uc) was an inspiring example of how the roles of technical writers should evolve. It is important for us, and our employers, to see more examples like these. If you are a technical writer with similar positive experiences, I encourage you to share them, as talks or blogs. This will help us build our case and help more of us have career trajectories.\\n\\nShort term, however, many of us are doing soul searching around what to do next. This is especially true when our superpower, writing great resumes and cover letters, gets drowned out by resumes created by generative AI. There are still opportunities for our voices to punch through, but there are volume issues to contend with.\\n\\n## Enter the Prioritization Matrix\\n\\nThe Prioritization Matrix, developed by [Jessica Abel](https://jessicaabel.com/) as part of her Creative Focus course, has served me well when choosing what creative project to do and works for me again as I look for the next (paid) opportunity. Jessica has even used this matrix to decide what fridge to buy.\\n\\nWith Jessica\u2019s permission, I\u2019ve created a version of the matrix tailored towards job search activities.

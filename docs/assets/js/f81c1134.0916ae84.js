Its tail is in front of of her face. A caption underneath reads \\"Dang brain weasels can make it hard to see!\\"](/img/blog/2025-05-26-neurodivergent.png)\\n## Creating a framework to manage the brain weasels\\n\\nWhenever life doesn\'t go to plan, there is an opportunity to self reflect and find opportunities to learn and grow. This is a useful habit to cultivate and can turn adversity into an alchemical experience. \\n\\nWhat is not helpful, is to look at the data, look at all the variables that go into being a human and come to the conclusion that you are a trash human/need to improve across all the criteria. This is especially challenging when you\'re not even sure what the criteria are, or perhaps the criteria changes as you analyze yourself from different angles.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Enter the Neurodivergent Quality of Life Prioritization (NQLP) Matrix \\n\\nWhile the [Job Search Prioritization Matrix](job-search) helps you think through what sorts of jobs to look for, the [NQLP Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/copy) helps you identify what\'s going well in your life and what improvements you want to prioritize. You get to choose what is important to you and self accept what\'s not a priority right now. You can\'t improve on all the criteria all the time. Maybe, for example, you need to focus on understanding when you\'re sleep deprived and hungry, and that in itself will help your distress tolerance around people being wrong.\\n\\nIf you choose to share your matrix with others it can be a helpful conversation starter. Sometimes people have narrow or stereotyped perceptions of what it means to be Autistic or have ADHD, through the matrix you have more opportunities to show the complexity of who you are. Maybe you\'re an Autistic person who\'s great with change, but oooh, emotional regulation when things are itchy? That might be on a totally different level.\\n\\n### The celebration is just as important as the improvements\\nOne of the reasons quality improvement projects can fail is because they spend too much time focusing on what needs to be improved without adequate celebration of what is going well. Don\'t skimp on celebrating anything that you do well.\\n\\n### A word of caution\\n\\nThis matrix could be a great tool for you to go over with a loved one or even some managers. But, a manager should never expect an employee to work on this matrix. This matrix is emotionally intimate and needs to be driven by the person filling in the matrix, not by an outside person, especially not an outside person with power.\\n\\n### A word of thanks and an invitation\\nThanks to the Write the Docs Portland conference for inspiring this spreadsheet. I created this while thinking about what sort of lightning talk I could do. I ended up doing a completely different lightning talk, but while I was at this conference I showed it to a lot of people. Thanks to everyone who asked questions, suggested extra criteria or laughed at the shared acknowledgements of imperfection. \\"Management of enthusiastic info dump over chat,\\" anyone? This matrix has been enriched by generosity of many neurodivergent people who shared their stories and challenges. What is easy to one person can\'t be taken for granted by another, and this matrix helps us see ourselves and others more clearly.\\n\\nThis resource was created with neurodivergent folks in mind, if only because neurotypical people seem to be more likely to recognize when they are hungry. That said, I bet this matrix could be useful to any human. To paraphrase Rick Green, \\"ADHD is like height, everyone has some. It\'s just that if you don\'t realize you\'re 10ft tall you might think you\'re just really clumsy and bad with ceiling fans, when no one else has those problems. You might be so convinced you\'re clumsy that you never think to try out for a basketball team.\\"\\n\\nSo, neurotypical or divergent, I encourage you to try out the spreadsheet, and I\'d love to hear how it goes.\\n\\n- [Create your own copy of the NQLP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/copy)\\n  - This link will create your own copy\\n- [Master document, where you can leave comments and provide feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gflZHBbMnVe6AopmU7T3MVIe2AslcvqaO8y66H27tLg/)\\n\\n## Media I\'m enjoying\\n\\n- Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti\\n  - [How to grow as a technical writer | Essay](https://passo.uno/how-to-grow-senior-tech-writer/)\\n  - [This I remind myself when working with others | Essay](https://passo.uno/tips-working-tech-writers-team/)\\n- Janine Chan, [7 habits of increasingly technical technical writers | Write the Docs | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkpXpvTk6iU)\\n    - Come for the growth mindset, stay for the practical tips on how to be a great colleague.\\n- Valeria Hernandez, [Rethinking the user journey for technical documentation | Essay](https://valeria-writes-docs.super.site/blog/rethinking-the-user-journey-for-technical-documentation)\\n    - I do love a nice template!\\n- Oliver Burkeman [The awkwardness principle: why change rarely feels right | Essay](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/awkwardness)\\n- Ana Akana, [How to put on your gace | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f49xeXdFSgc)\\n\\n\\n### Want to read more blog posts?\\n[Subscribe to my newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/520551e04a4d/documentarians-rock) to be emailed whenever I do an update!"},{"id":"job-search","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/job-search","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-19-job-search.mdx","title":"Job search prioritization matrix","description":"Searching for work in 2025","date":"2025-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Friends","permalink":"/blog/tags/friends","description":"Friendship is magic.

And see ourselves more clearly?](/img/blog/2025-05-19-job_prioritization.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## The state of things\\n\\nIt would be an understatement to say that the lives of technical writers have been destabilized by the advent of generative AI. LLMs have made it clear that many people don\u2019t understand what we do and how much technical writers create process and maintain structures. We are more than content creators! \\n\\nTechnical writers can be powerful facilitators and diplomats, bridging gaps between teams, helping more of an organization see each other more clearly. People might see our large doc sites and think \u201ctoo many words!\u201d When what they don\u2019t see is how our docs are much more succinct and equitably distributed than half remembered conversations that happen over and over, with less validation and more disruptions to SMEs\' time.\\n\\nOur docs are not perfect, but too often the cry of \u201c[too many notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6_eqxh-Qok)!\u201d can be a reflection of a) it is not the quantity, but the structure needs work, b) documentation is most needed when a person is new and [the curse of knowledge](https://ucatt.arizona.edu/news/curse-knowledge) can make some content seem redundant or c) it can be upsetting to see your systems more clearly. We bear witness to what is and give voice to what is quietly understood, and that can be an uncomfortable thing.\\n\\nAt the recent Write the Docs conference in Portland, [Yanjie Niu\u2019s talk, \u201cThe Power of Two: How Support and Documentation Teams Transform Technical Content Quality,\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K6Bz9LM6Uc) was an inspiring example of how the roles of technical writers should evolve. It is important for us, and our employers, to see more examples like these. If you are a technical writer with similar positive experiences, I encourage you to share them, as talks or blogs. This will help us build our case and help more of us have career trajectories.\\n\\nShort term, however, many of us are doing soul searching around what to do next. This is especially true when our superpower, writing great resumes and cover letters, gets drowned out by resumes created by generative AI. There are still opportunities for our voices to punch through, but there are volume issues to contend with.\\n\\n## Enter the Prioritization Matrix\\n\\nThe Prioritization Matrix, developed by [Jessica Abel](https://jessicaabel.com/) as part of her Creative Focus course, has served me well when choosing what creative project to do and works for me again as I look for the next (paid) opportunity. Jessica has even used this matrix to decide what fridge to buy.\\n\\nWith Jessica\u2019s permission, I\u2019ve created a version of the matrix tailored towards job search activities. Using this matrix comes in about a quarter of the way through the course, so I\u2019ve created some instructions tailored towards job search to help you get to a basic decision criteria.\\n\\n- [https://tinyurl.com/job-search-template](https://tinyurl.com/job-search-template)\\n  - This link will create your own copy\\n- [https://tinyurl.com/job-search-prioritization](https://tinyurl.com/job-search-prioritization)\\n  - This link will take you to the master document, where you can leave comments and provide feedback.\\n\\nWe are impatient humans, so you may want to jump straight into playing with the template, but you\u2019ll get even more out of it if you try out some of the instructions!\\n\\n## Further reading\\n\\n- Open Source, [\u201cFanaka, A handbook for African success in the international software industry.\u201d](https://fanaka.readthedocs.io/)\\n  - Great advice for job seekers in any part of the world.\\n  - [Contributions are welcome](https://fanaka.readthedocs.io/contribute/) (and could look good on a CV)\\n- Bob Watson, \u201c[A look at the past to see the future of technical writing.\u201d](https://docsbydesign.com/2024/03/18/a-look-at-the-past-to-see-the-future-of-technical-writing/)\\n- Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti, \u201c[Technical writing in 2049.\u201d](https://passo.uno/tech-writing-predictions-2049/)\\n- Not Boring Tech Writer, [\u201cKate sounds off on docs hierarchy of needs and how we talk to ourselves.\u201d](https://thenotboringtechwriter.com/episodes/kate-sounds-off-on-docs-hierarchy-of-needs-and-how-we-talk-to-ourselves)\\n  - Go to nine minutes in for recognizing our superpowers and giving ourselves self-compassion.\\n  - We\u2019ll need this self-compassion to be effective advocates for ourselves.\\n- [Yanjie Niu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K6Bz9LM6Uc)\\n    - Write the Docs talk, \u201cThe Power of Two: How Support and Documentation Teams Transform Technical Content Quality.\u201d\\n- Jessica Abel [https://jessicaabel.com/](https://jessicaabel.com/)\\n  - If you have a frustrated creative soul, I recommend checking out her blog, podcasts and workshops.
